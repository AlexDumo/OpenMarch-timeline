/**
 * Step 15's route fixtures, moved to lanes (spec v0.10, plan step 24; QA-MIG-L2 in memory).
 *
 * The route tests were written against step 15's storage: a transition with `style: "route"`, its
 * `route`, and `params.offset` for a group member. `withLanes` rewrites each such transition as
 * migration 0020 rewrites a file: the transition becomes `direct` with no params, and slot 0 gets
 * a lane on its route with the offset (null for an own path). The tests' expected values are step
 * 15's, so every one of them that still passes is the bit-identity QA-RT-L1 asks for.
