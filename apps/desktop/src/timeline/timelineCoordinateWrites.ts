 * The seam between the page-era coordinate tools and timeline writes in timeline mode
 * (docs/timeline/phases/07-page-parity.md P7.2, reworked for UI-9 by P8.15 and UI-10 by P8.17).
 * Canvas drag, nudges, snap, align, distribute, flip, swap, circle, the line tool and the
 * inspector's coordinate edits all compute new x/y for the selected marchers. In timeline mode
 * they edit against the **edit window** (docs/timeline/ui.md UI-10), not a page
 * (`planCanvasEdit`):
 *
 * - a window `[S, P)`: where the moved marchers arrive at the playhead P, leaving the start flag
 *   S. The move creates the window's timeline and adds the marchers to it as needed
 *   (`moveMarchersInRangeInTransaction`), starting from the resolver's positions at P;
 * - home (the playhead on beat 0): the marchers' homes;
 * - an isolated timeline (docs/timeline/research/ownership/09-isolation.md): the timeline's own
 *   endings, from where its plan puts its members (`editingPositionAt`), for stolen members too.
 *   The playhead goes to the timeline's end first (`snapIsolatedPlayheadToEnd`), so the edit is
 *   seen where it lands.
 *
 * Nothing selected is refused with a hint (`TimelineEditRefusedError`). "Set marchers to the
 * previous or next page" (P7.6) still copies page positions through `copyPagePositions` until
 * P8.12 moves it onto the selection. With the flag off, nothing here runs.
