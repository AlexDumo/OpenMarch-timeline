/**
 * What the field draws for an isolated timeline (docs/timeline/research/ownership/09-isolation.md,
 * after 07-ghost-rendering.md phase G0). Pure: it reads the resolver and the timeline's rows and
 * returns plain data, which `TimelineFocusLayer` draws.
 *
 * For each member of the isolated timeline F over `[start, end]`:
 *
 * - **performed**: where the member is in F (the resolver's span is one of F's transitions), its
 *   real path, solid in F's color.
 * - **ghost**: beats after the member has started performing F where another move owns it (it was
 *   stolen out, R-4) or F only resumes it with a catch-up (`resume`, D-12): F's planned path for it
 *   over those beats, gray and dashed. Planned means as if nothing had stolen it: a throwaway
 *   resolver over F's transitions alone, with every member starting where it really is at F's start
 *   (the `sampleShape` pattern in `timelineMoves.ts`).
 * - **context**: the move that takes the member out of F, drawn over its own whole span (one hop),
 *   in that move's color, so a move that runs past F's end shows.
 * - **origin**, **destination**, **ghost end** and **forks**: where the member starts, where it
 *   really ends in F (if F still has it at its end), where F's plan would end it (if not), and
 *   where it leaves F.
 *
 * Not drawn yet: the approach of a member that joins F partway (its planned start isn't stored
 * until ghost starts exist, WP-O3).
