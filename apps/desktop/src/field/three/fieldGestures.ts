/**
 * The field's gesture adapter (tablet plan 1.1): one place where finger and
 * pen presses on the field become editing, navigation and menus. It feeds
 * each press to the gesture rules (`components/canvas/touch/touchGestures.ts`,
 * pure, timestamped) and carries out the effects they return:
 *
 * - A single finger's press does what {@link FieldGestureOptions.singleFinger}
 *   says: `"edit"` hands it to the editor (`pointerDown`/`Move`/`Up`, and
 *   `pointerCancel` when a second finger lands), `"navigate"` moves the view
 *   once it leaves the tap slop. Today one finger always navigates (decision 1
 *   is deferred); later tickets choose per press (on a marcher, a tool armed,
 *   the drag mode on the pill).
 * - Two or more fingers pan and pinch the view. The field point under the
 *   fingers stays under them, one to one.
 * - A finger held still and then lifted without moving asks the editor for
 *   a menu (`longPress`) where it lifted, as a right-click does: a mode's,
 *   else the field's. Holding still only arms it: a finger that moves on
 *   after the hold carries on as a drag or pan (a hesitant finger still
 *   drags). The editor's press stays alive while armed; on the release it's
 *   given up for the menu, or, with no menu, ends as a slow tap.
 * - Two- and three-finger taps go to {@link FieldGestureOptions.history}.
 * - A pen is only watched, for palm rejection by timing: fingers are ignored
 *   while it is down and only navigate (with two fingers) just after.
 *   The pen's presses reach the editor as a mouse's do, through
 *   `fieldPointerInput.ts`, which also times its long press.
 *
 * Mouse presses never come here.
