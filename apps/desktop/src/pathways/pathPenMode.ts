/**
 * The path pen on the field (pathways steps 1 and 2), working as the shape tool's Line does:
 *
 * - Drawing: a click places the next point, a corner, landed on its release (on the half-step
 *   grid or a field line; off the grid with fine, at 45° from the last with constrain). A
 *   press-and-drag places a smooth point where it was pressed instead, its roundness how far the
 *   drag went (in tenths, fine for any), its tangent bar shown while dragging. A
 *   double-click, a click on the last point or on the end spot, or Enter finishes; a right-click,
 *   Backspace or undo takes the last point back; Escape cancels.
 * - Closed (the selected marcher's path, shown) or selected (a path object, step 3a): the path
 *   takes no press, so drags and marquees around it are the field's, and a dot under the press is
 *   the dot's (P-1). A click or tap on its line, or on one of Paths All's paths (AP-O2), selects
 *   that path as an object (AP-O3), and the second click of a double-click opens it; a click on
 *   empty field lets a selected path go (AP-O4). A right-click or long press on a line selects it
 *   too and opens the field's menu with Edit path and Remove path.
 * - Open: the path takes only presses on its handles, so the marchers stay selectable. A click on
 *   a point selects it, and a selected smooth point shows its tangent bar, whose ends drag its
 *   roundness; a double-click on a point swaps corner and smooth; a drag moves a point (fine off
 *   the grid, constrain keeping its direction), saved on release as one undo step; a click on a
 *   leg's midpoint adds a point there, and a drag adds one and moves it. A right-click or long
 *   press opens a point's menu (Corner | Smooth, Roundness, Delete point) or a leg's (Add point
 *   here, Straight | Curved), and elsewhere on the line the field's menu with Remove path. A click
 *   on empty field changes the selection, which closes it.
 *
 * The held-roles chip names what a drag reads, from the press, as it does for a shape's handles.
