/**
 * Showing and setting a line's order (pathways step 4g, DL-26..DL-33), outside React:
 *
 * - `forms`: every order form in the show (`readOrderForms`), read once and again after each
 *   undoable edit, undo and redo, only while something shows the order. What each beat and
 *   selection shows is worked out from them in memory, so the line costs no read per frame.
 * - `sweep`: Set order while it's on: the selected marchers, where they stand at its beat, who has
 *   been picked so far and where the pointer is. Its line redraws on the pointer's frame.
