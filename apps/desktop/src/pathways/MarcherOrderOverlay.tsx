/**
 * A line's order on the field (pathways steps 4h and 4i): a lane under the line's dots, fading from
 * dark at the leader to pale at the tail, cut away round every dot so dots and selection rings keep
 * their own color, with a solid tip past the leader (the drawing rules are `orderLane`). It carries
 * its own ground on any floor: a light wash just strong enough for the floor under it (`floor`; none
 * on a white field), a faint rim, and a halo round each of its dots in the tone that sets that dot's
 * color apart. The fade is multiplied onto the field, so it reads as ink. An order that runs back over its own
 * marchers loses the tip and shows its numbers; one whose legs cross thins to a thread with darts and
 * shows its numbers. A guessed order isn't drawn at rest; while Alt is held it shows hollow and
 * dashed. Position badges show while Alt is held, and always while Set order is on (touch has no
 * Alt). Set order draws the lane it has picked so far, growing behind the pointer, with the bar that
 * says how to go on and keeps or cancels it.
 *
 * The forms are read once per edit (`followOrderForms`), the selection's only unless Always shows
 * every line; what's drawn follows the camera and where the lines' marchers are drawn
 * (`FieldMarchers`), so it's worked out again only when either changes. It sits over the selection
 * box and its handles, takes no presses, and hides while the Follow tool or a shape tool is open
 * (they draw their own ends).
