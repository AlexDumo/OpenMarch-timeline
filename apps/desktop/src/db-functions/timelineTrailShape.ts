/**
 * The dragged-out result as a shape, pathways step 4c (spec Appendix L.5, DL-11 to DL-14): the end
 * spots a trail drag writes (AP-T8) described as a shape the shape tools open as their own.
 *
 * - Spots on one straight line: a **Line** (`line` v2), its two ends.
 * - Spots on one circle, in order round it: an **Arc** (`arc` v2), its two ends, the first bent.
 * - Anything else: a **Curve**, which the shape tools store as a Line whose points are each a
 *   Corner (tension 0) or Smooth. It is the way `P` from the first spot to the last, and passes
 *   through every spot exactly.
 *
 * The recipe records each member where it was written, so opening it moves nobody; the first
 * change to the shape lays it out as the shape tools always do (DL-14). Pure.
