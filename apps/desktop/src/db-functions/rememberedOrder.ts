/**
 * The order the show remembers for a line of marchers (pathways step 4f, DL-21): the Follow tool
 * reads it instead of guessing the order from where the marchers stand.
 *
 * A **form** is something the show stored that puts marchers in a sequence, or that ends one:
 *
 * - a follow trail (`readTrails`): its members by slot, the order they walk in;
 * - a placed Line or Arc (a shape recipe whose spots run along it): its members by slot, with the
 *   slots of members who left by hand kept as holes;
 * - any other placed shape (a box, a circle, a group) or an ungrouped mark: it takes the marchers
 *   into something with no line order, so it ends the order they had;
 * - an order set by hand (Set order and Reverse, step 4g: an order mark), which sets it, and one
 *   cleared by hand (Clear order), which ends it. They store no shape and move no one.
 *
 * Orders run leader first: a trail's leader (who walks first), a placed shape's first spot, the
 * first marcher swept through by hand.
 *
 * An order holds, like a placed shape, until a later form takes the marchers. Moving one marcher by
 * hand doesn't end it: the shape it leaves keeps its spot as a hole, and a shape with holes that
 * agrees with the order in force only carries it on.
