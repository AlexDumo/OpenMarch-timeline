/**
 * "Move a marcher on page N" in timeline mode (docs/timeline/phases/07-page-parity.md P7.2, spec
 * D-16): every canvas drag, nudge, alignment and line tool ends here.
 *
 * - **Page 0** (the first page, `previousPageId === null`): marchers stand on their homes until
 *   their first move, so the move sets `marchers.home_x`/`home_y`.
 * - **Page N ≥ 1**: the marcher's position at N's end beat B (`pageEndBeat`) is the destination of
 *   the slot it arrives in at B. The move finds the assignment that wins the marcher's last span
 *   before B (R-2: the highest layer among its rows with `start < B ≤ end`), requires that both the
 *   assignment and its transition end at B, and sets that slot's destination. Because assignments
 *   are unique per (transition, slot), no other marcher moves with it.
 *
 * Decisions, recorded in the Phase 7 log:
 *
 * - **A shape-backed transition** is switched to individual destinations in the same edit, copying
 *   every slot's point from the shape's samples, and then the moved slots are updated (the Q-14
 *   workaround). The copies stop following later edits to the shape; the shape row itself is
 *   untouched. A follow-the-leader transition needs its shape (I-T5), so it is refused (`E-T5`).
 * - **No assignment ending at B** (the marcher holds through B, is in the middle of a longer move at
 *   B, or its move's transition doesn't end at B) is refused (`E-ARGS`) with a message naming the
 *   marcher by its drill number. Creating a transition or assignment for it is left to the timeline UI
 *   (P8.9).
 *
 * Every refusal is decided before the first write: the rows, shapes and shape samples are all read
 * and checked first, so a refused move writes nothing. A database rejection during the writes
 * (not expected once those checks pass) rolls back the whole edit.

/**
 * UI-10 Dragging adds: sets where each moved marcher arrives at `range.end`, leaving
 * `range.start`. Creates the timeline over `range` when none has it (one per range, C-12), adds
 * every moved marcher that isn't in it (`addMarchersToTimelineInTransaction`: its own one-slot
 * transition, one layer above its highest layer over the range), then sets their endings
 * (`moveMarchersInTimelineInTransaction`). Refusals are the add's and the move's, decided before
 * they write; inside one transaction, a refused move rolls back the add too.
 *
 * Only real moves are written (defined-coordinates README, Recommendation 2; positions compared
 * within `SAME_POSITION_TOLERANCE`):
 *
 * - **No-op:** a marcher moved to where it already is at `range.end` gets no row and no write, so
 *   an align or distribute that keeps a marcher still plants nothing there. When nobody moves, no
 *   timeline is created.
 * - **Drag back:** on a page's box, a marcher whose own move there (`ownPageMoves`) is moved back to
 *   where the box starts loses that move instead of keeping one that goes nowhere, so the page
 *   follows earlier pages again. Its timeline goes when that leaves it empty. A zero-motion ending
 *   in a shared transition, or in a window that isn't a page's box, is kept.
 * - **`clearOwn`** (set to previous page): every moved marcher's own move over the box is deleted
 *   the same way, whatever the move says; the others are moved as usual.
 *
 * The add passes through (research/ownership/10-cross-page-windows.md): the drag overrides the
 * moved marchers' moves inside the range, a move the range runs into partway catches up after it,
 * and every page flag inside the range is passed. The result's `passThrough` names them, so the
 * app can say so.
