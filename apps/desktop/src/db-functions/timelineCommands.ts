 * - **A marcher:** the transition has no shape and one slot, whose destination is the marcher's

 *   doesn't jump at the range start: it holds still there until the destination is edited. That

 *   move resumes afterwards with a catch-up, a visible change of speed.
 * - **A shape:** the transition goes into the shape with one slot per marcher, and each marcher
 *   takes the slot nearest to where it stands at `startBeat` (nearest-slot casting, P8.4, so the
 *   total distance is as small as it can be). A block with fewer cells than marchers is refused
 *   (`E-T4`).
 *
 * **The layer** (decision UI-6 in ui.md): the assignments go one layer above the highest layer the
 * marchers already have in the range, or at 0 where they have none there, so the new track steals
 * the range (R-2) the way a breakaway does (golden vector G2). A layer-0 track over a converted
 * show's page moves would always overlap them (E-A3).
 *
 * Refused before anything is written: a range that isn't whole beats inside `[0, 2³¹ − 1]` with
 * positive length, a missing marcher or shape, no marchers for a shape, or a marcher named twice
