/**
 * Page and beat ripple (docs/timeline/phases/07-page-parity.md P7.4, P7.5).
 *
 * Timeline rows hold beat ordinals: beat `n` is the `n`th row of `beats` ordered by position,
 * counting from 0 (ADR 0001). Pages are time labels over those beats. So any edit that inserts,
 * deletes or reorders beats, or moves, adds or removes a page, has to rewrite timeline rows in the
 * same edit, or the rows end up over the wrong music. `withTimelinePageRipple` does that: in
 * timeline mode it reads the page grid (beat ids in order, and each page's beat range) before the
 * page-mode edit runs, reads it again afterwards, and rewrites every timeline, transition and
 * assignment to match, inside the same transaction, so one undo restores everything.
 *
 * **How a row's beats move.** Every row edge is mapped from the old grid to the new one:
 *
 * - Any row's edge on a page boundary follows that page, whether or not the row is a page move:
 *   a row ending where page N ends ends where page N ends now; a row starting where page N
 *   starts starts where page N starts now. So a track ending on a page boundary grows with that
 *   page when beats are inserted at the boundary, as the page's own move does. That is what
 *   makes the converted show (one transition per page) behave as page mode does: inserting beats
 *   inside a page, or right after it, lengthens its move; resizing a page moves the boundary it
 *   shares with the next page, so the move ending there and the move starting there both change
 *   (an R-E1 edit of each; their anchored assignments follow). The edge falls back to the beat
 *   rule below when following the page would leave the row with no beats (a short row inside a
 *   page that ends at the page end, when the page is split before it).
 * - Any other edge follows its beat. A start stays at the start of its beat; an end stays at the
 *   end of the beat before it. So inserting k beats at ordinal p shifts every row starting at or
 *   after p by k, grows every row that strictly contains p, and leaves rows ending at p alone
 *   (unless p is a page boundary, above);
 *   deleting beats shrinks the rows that held them and shifts the rows after them. An edge whose
 *   beat was deleted moves to the next surviving beat (a start) or the previous one (an end).
 *
 * **When a page goes away** (deleted, or its start beat is deleted), its page moves go with it:
 * each shapeless transition whose assignments are all layer 0 and cover it, and that ends at the
 * page's flag or lies inside its box (what the converter writes, and every such move a merged box
 * holds after flag deletes, `isPageMove`), is deleted with its assignments and destinations. Any
 * other transition is never deleted here; one that would lose all its beats refuses the edit
 * instead (`E-ARGS`, naming it and its timeline). The page before then ends where the deleted page
 * ended, so its move stretches over the deleted page's beats, as in page mode (where those
 * coordinates are lost and the earlier page's move runs until the next page starts). A marcher's
 * row that would stretch into its next row at the same layer (a track, or a move crossing the
 * deleted page's flag) stops where that row starts instead.
 * A timeline left with no transition goes too (C-11: a timeline is the container for its moves).
 *
 * **When a page is added** (inserted, split off, or added at the end), nothing is written for it.
 * Page mode copies the previous page's coordinates onto a new page; here a marcher with no move over
 * the new page simply holds where it last was (C-12: no path writes timeline rows on behalf of a
 * page), so a later edit to an earlier page carries through the new page until that marcher's next
 * own move. A move over the page is written only when the designer moves someone there.
 *
 * **Refusals.** The ripple of existing rows is planned before its first timeline write, and the
 * edit is refused when a row would end up with no beats (`E-ARGS`), an assignment would leave its
 * transition (`E-A1`), a transition would leave its timeline (`E-T1`), or two of a marcher's rows
 * at one layer would overlap or swap order (`E-A3`). The whole edit then rolls back, page-mode
 * statements included, so nothing is written.
 *
 * **Statement order** (U-3: every intermediate state passes the row triggers, so undo can replay
 * the edit backwards):
 *
 * 1. delete the removed pages' transitions, children first (C-1), then the timelines they emptied;
 * 2. every changed timeline grows to the union of its old and new range;
 * 3. every changed transition grows to the union of its old and new range;
 * 4. each changed assignment moves to its new range in one statement. Within one marcher and
 *    layer, a row moves only after the rows its new range would overlap have moved out of the way
 *    (that order always exists when the rows keep their order);
 * 5. every changed transition shrinks to its new range;
 * 6. every changed timeline shrinks to its new range.
