 * marchers, Removing marchers, Layers, One timeline per range, One transition per marcher;
 * implementation-plan.md C-12).
 *
 * - **Add selected marchers** gives each marcher its own one-slot shapeless `direct` transition
 *   spanning the timeline (C-11), whose destination is where the marcher is at the timeline's
 *   end, so adding changes no motion on a linear path. The timeline is created the first time
 *   marchers are added to its range; at most one timeline has a given range.
 * - **Layers:** the new assignment goes one layer above the marcher's highest layer over the
 *   range, so it steals those beats (R-2) from the timelines that wholly contain it. A timeline
 *   that only partly overlaps one of the marcher's timelines is refused (E-ARGS).
 * - **Remove** deletes the marcher's assignments in the timeline and the one-slot transitions they
 *   leave empty, but never the timeline: a timeline stays stored, and selectable, with nobody in
 *   it (an exception to P8.10's rule that a timeline goes with its last transition).
 *
 * Every refusal is decided before the first write, so a refused edit writes nothing.
