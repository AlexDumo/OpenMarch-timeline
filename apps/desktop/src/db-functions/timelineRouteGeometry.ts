/**
 * The one place a route's geometry is rewritten (pathways step 3b, spec v0.10 AP-H1): every path
 * edit, redraw, cut and Re-fit goes through `writeRouteGeometryInTransaction`, so a key anchored on
 * a point that went is re-homed in the same edit and never dropped silently. A new route has
 * nothing anchored on it, so inserting one doesn't come here.
 *
 * What AP-H1 also names plugs in here beside the lanes' profiles: pins (step 5) go with their
 * points; handoff ramps (step 25), holds (step 14) and linked Adjusts (step 26) will. AP-R21's merge and join
 * (still refused, AP-R6) write through this helper when they arrive.
