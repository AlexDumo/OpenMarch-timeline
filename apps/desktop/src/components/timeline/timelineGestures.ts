/**
 * The timeline's gesture adapter (tablet plan 3.1): where a finger's press on the timeline goes.
 * Like the field's (`field/three/fieldGestures.ts`) it feeds finger presses to the pure gesture
 * rules (`touchGestures.ts` `stepGesture`) and carries out the effects they return.
 *
 * - A finger on a control (a clip, a flag, a page box, a grip, the tempo band, a button) is the
 *   control's: the press goes on to it untouched, so one finger on a clip moves it and one finger
 *   on a page box scrubs, as a mouse does.
 * - A finger on bare ruler or page row (the pinned header) scrubs, through the timeline surface's
 *   own pointer handlers, as a mouse does.
 * - A finger on bare track space pans the timeline once it leaves the tap slop (sideways and,
 *   when the tracks overflow, up and down). A tap there seeks, as a click does.
 * - Two fingers pan and pinch anywhere ({@link timelineNavigation}).
 * - A finger held still (within the gesture rules' long press slop, so a little jitter still
 *   counts) and then lifted opens the menu a right-click opens there, as on the field (tablet
 *   plan 3.4): the adapter sends a `contextmenu` to what the finger pressed. When a menu opened,
 *   the press is cancelled (whatever it started goes back) and its click goes nowhere. With no
 *   menu there, the press ends as a slow tap.
 * - A second finger cancels whatever the first one started: the first press gets a
 *   `pointercancel`, and every timeline drag puts its state back on one.
 *
 * Mouse and pen presses never come here: desktop behavior is unchanged.
