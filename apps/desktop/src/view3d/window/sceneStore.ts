/**
 * What the 3D View scene has built, for the camera rig (P3.2) and the overlay
 * (P3.3). `Scene.tsx` (P3.1) is the only writer.
 *
 * - `kit`: the current `KitResult`, or null while nothing is built. Use its
 *   `cameras` for the camera bar, `pickTargets` and `seatRows` for
 *   pick-a-seat, and `lightingPresets` for the lighting control. `kitId` is
 *   the registry id it was built from. Don't dispose it: the scene does.
 * - `crowd`: the crowd handle, or null when the crowd is off or the kit has
 *   no seat rows. The camera rig calls `crowd.clearAround(position,
 *   CROWD_CLEAR_RADIUS)` when the camera lands. The scene clears around the
 *   camera once whenever it builds a crowd.
 * - `focus`: the kit's default look-at point (normally the field center).
 * - `lighting`: the preset actually applied (the stored one, or the kit's
 *   default when the stored one doesn't fit the kit).
 * - `quality`: the render quality the scene builds for. `low` drops
 *   shadows and halves the crowd.
 * - `hornState`: which hold the brass plays. Always `up` for shows; the
 *   settings panel can switch it to check the other holds (`hornState.ts`).
 * - `stepOffFoot`: which foot the band steps off on; `right` plays every
 *   clip mirrored. A window setting until the show stores it.
 * - `powerPrefs`: pause drawing when nothing moves, and cap the frame rate
 *   on battery (`drawPolicy.ts`); saved per computer. Set it with
 *   `setPowerPrefs`. `onBattery` is the window's own reading of the battery.
 * - `qualityMode`: the viewer's choice in the settings panel (`auto`, `low`
 *   or `high`), saved per computer. Set it with `setQualityMode`. In `auto`
 *   the scene lowers `quality` once with `_autoLower()` when frames are slow
 *   (P5.1), and `autoLowered` says so.
 *
 * Read it in React with `useView3dSceneStore(selector)`, and in `useFrame` or
 * event handlers with `useView3dSceneStore.getState()`.
 *
 * The camera rig (`camera/CameraRig.tsx`, P3.2) places the camera: it
 * watches `kit` and opens each new venue on its default camera.
