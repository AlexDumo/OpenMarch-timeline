/**
 * Arm poses for carrying an instrument (docs/3d/instruments.md §5), as
 * target points in the body's rest frame: where the elbow and wrist go and
 * which way the fingers point, for each arm, plus where the instrument sits.
 * `armPose.ts` aims the bones at these. The wrists and the "elbow out"
 * direction come from the owner's reference photos; each elbow is then the
 * point 0.205 m from the shoulder and 0.264 m from the wrist nearest that
 * direction (the arm's bone lengths), so every target is reachable. Tune
 * them here, nowhere else.
 *
 * Frame: meters, +X the performer's left, +Y up, +Z forward. Landmarks
 * (class 1.00): shoulders at (±0.185, 1.397), chest front z 0.12, chin
 * y 1.52, eye line y 1.62. Upper arm 0.205 m, forearm 0.264 m.
 * Pure: no three.js.

/**
 * Bass clarinet: its body hangs 0.124 m toward the keys from the mouthpiece
 * and runs a meter long, so it plays nearly vertical, tipped 10 degrees
 * out, the neck bringing the mouthpiece up into the lips. Left hand on the
 * upper cups (0.33 m along); the right arm hangs almost straight to reach
 * the lower ones (0.6 m along), its fingers angled down to them.
 *
 * Carry (owner, 2026-10-09): as the saxes, vertical and turned a quarter
 * with the keys to the performer's right, the mouthpiece at eye level and
 * the body tube on the center line. The crook and bell, which turn toward
 * the keys, sit low at the right side.
 *
 * Trail: level at the right side like the saxes, the fist round the body
 * 0.5 m along with the mouthpiece in front. The keys face the ground so the
 * crook and bell hang below the tube behind the leg.
