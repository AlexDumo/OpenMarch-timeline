/**
 * The timeline-mode selection and paused playhead (docs/timeline/ui.md UI-9, C-12; P8.11).
 *
 * In timeline mode there is no selected page. What the designer edits is the **selection**, and
 * where the canvas, playback and the inspector look is the **playhead**. They are independent:
 * seeking moves only the playhead, and selecting moves the playhead to the selection's end (home
 * moves it to beat 0).
 *
 * - **home**: page 0. No timeline is selected; nothing is dimmed and moves edit homes (at beat 0).
 * - **range**: a timeline's range in spec beats, half-open `[start, end)`. A page box selects its
 *   page's range (previous flag to its own flag); a dragged range is selected the same way. The
 *   range resolves to the stored timeline with exactly that range when there is one (at most one
 *   per range, C-12), so the selection survives the first **Add selected marchers** storing the
 *   timeline and an undo deleting it. Read the stored timeline with `selectedStoredTimeline` or
 *   `useSelectedStoredTimeline`.
 * - **none**: nothing selected.
 *
 * Every beat here is a spec beat position (`beats` index, spec §7). The zero-length beat 0 and
 * beat 1 are both show time 0; the playhead writes that time as 0 (`normalizePlayheadBeat`).
 *
 * `storedTimelines` is a read model of every stored timeline and who is in it, kept current by
 * `useTimelineSelectionHost` (mounted by `TimelineResolverHost`) after each timeline write, undo
 * and redo. It is `null` until first loaded and outside timeline mode.
 *
 * Page mode doesn't read this store.
