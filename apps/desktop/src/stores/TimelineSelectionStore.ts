/**
 * The timeline-mode edit window and paused playhead (docs/timeline/ui.md UI-9, UI-10, C-12;
 * P8.11, P8.17).
 *
 * In timeline mode there is no selected page. What the designer edits is the **edit window**, from
 * the **start flag** S to the paused **playhead** P (UI-10): movers leave S and arrive at P. The
 * window is stored as `selection`, derived from S, P and the page boxes on every change:
 *
 * - **home**: P at beat 0. No timeline is selected; nothing is dimmed and moves edit homes.
 * - **range**: `[S, P)` when P is after S; otherwise (P on or before S, just after **Stop**) the
 *   page box ending at or holding P, as if S followed P. A range resolves to the stored timeline
 *   with exactly that range when there is one (at most one per range, C-12). Read it with
 *   `selectedStoredTimeline` or `useSelectedStoredTimeline`.
 * - **none**: nothing selected (`selectNothing`).
 *
 * The start flag follows navigation unless pinned (UI-10, _lead default_): `seek` and
 * `selectRange` put S on the start of the page box holding P. `selectRange` pins S when it isn't
 * there (a dragged range, the start handle). A pinned S stays until P moves to or before it.
 * Playback never moves S: pausing and **Stop** use `seekKeepingStart`.
 *
 * Every beat here is a spec beat position (`beats` index, spec §7). The zero-length beat 0 and
 * beat 1 are both show time 0; the playhead writes that time as 0 (`normalizePlayheadBeat`).
 *
 * `storedTimelines` is a read model of every stored timeline and who is in it, kept current by
 * `useTimelineSelectionHost` (mounted by `TimelineResolverHost`) after each timeline write, undo
 * and redo. It is `null` until first loaded and outside timeline mode. `pageBoxes` is kept by
 * `TimelineModePanel`.
 *
 * **Isolation** (docs/timeline/research/ownership/09-isolation.md, _prototype_): double-clicking a
 * stored timeline's clip or page box isolates it. The window becomes its range, the playhead stays
 * inside it, marchers outside it are dimmed and locked (`isMarcherDimmed`), and play loops it.
 * Esc, a page box or home, a dragged range, or the timeline going away ends isolation and puts S
 * and P back where they were.
 *
 * Page mode doesn't read this store.
