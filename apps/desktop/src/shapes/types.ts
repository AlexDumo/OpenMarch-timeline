/**
 * The shape tool's contract (docs/timeline/research/shapes/README.md, 03-shape-model.md §2).
 *
 * A shape kind is one module that declares its parameters, handles and slot generator. The
 * panel, the canvas preview, assignment and validation are generic and never switch on the kind,
 * so a new kind is one file plus one registry line.
 *
 * Shapes are in place: a kind only says where the selected marchers stand at one moment. Motion
 * and timing stay in the timeline, which the tool writes through like a canvas drag.
 *
 * Units: points and lengths are field units (canvas pixels). The panel shows lengths in steps,
 * converting with {@link ShapeContext.stepPx}.
