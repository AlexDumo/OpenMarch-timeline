/**
 * `.dots` file-format version, stored in SQLite's `PRAGMA user_version`.
 *
 * See ADR 0012 §6 (docs/adr/0012-timeline-motion-model.md). The app reads the
 * version before it changes anything in a file, and refuses a file written by a
 * newer release instead of rewriting its version and migrating it.
 *
 * - 7: page model. 7 is left over from the pre-Drizzle migration system; every
 *   Drizzle-era file before timelines is at 7. The app converts it to 8 when it
 *   opens it, once the person confirms (`convertOnOpen.ts`).
 * - 8: timeline model. New files start here.
 * - 9: a fork-only floor model (the field image as an embedded Base floor), since parked. No
 *   release wrote it. Such a file opens as the timeline file it is and is written back as 8,
 *   with its floor's image put back as the field image (`parkedFloor.ts`).
 * - 10: route model (ADR 0014, pathways steps 1 to 15, fork lab builds only). A move could follow
 *   a drawn path, stored in `timeline_routes` and walked by one-slot `route` transitions. Such a
 *   file opens here: migration 0020 moves its paths to lanes, and it is then written as 11.
 * - 11: lane model (ADR 0015 §9, pathways step 24). A slot walks a route through a lane
 *   (`timeline_lanes`), so a path no longer moves a marcher out of its move. A build that doesn't
 *   know lanes would play such a file wrong and edit it wrong (compact, split or recast a laned
 *   show and leave lanes on the wrong spot), so a file is written as 11 with its first lane (drawing
 *   a path), or when it opens with lanes (a migrated version-10 file). A file without a lane stays
 *   at the version it had. ADR 0015 §9: each later step that stores a fact an older build would
 *   play or edit wrong takes the next number; a number a lab build wrote is never reused.
 * - 12: Adjust (pathways step 3b, spec J.1 and J.2): a lane has its own displacement profile. A
 *   build that doesn't know it would walk that spot on the plain lane, so a file is written as 12
 *   with its first Adjust. A file without one stays at the version it had. The number is not
 *   lowered when an Adjust is reset or undone, as 11 isn't when the last path goes.
 * - 13: trails (pathways step 4, spec Appendix K): a follow-the-leader move follows a drawn trail
 *   (`timeline_transitions.route_id`), may have no destination shape (I-T5′, R-13′) and may be
 *   reversed (`path_params.reverse`, R-12′). A build that doesn't know trails would fail to resolve
 *   such a move, or walk it straight, so a file is written as 13 with its first Follow. A file
 *   without one stays at the version it had, and the number is not lowered when the trail goes.
 * - 14: arc legs (pathways step 10a, spec Appendix L, R-14″): a route point may carry `bulge` and
 *   a route `toBulge`, so a leg of a path or trail is a circular arc. A build that doesn't know
 *   them would walk the leg straight, or refuse the route, so a file is written as 14 when a route
 *   first gets a bulge. A file without one stays at the version it had, and the number is not
 *   lowered when the last arc goes.
