# Tempo decisions log

One entry per decision made while building: context, choice, alternatives, how to validate.
Feel-based ones also have a row in
[VALIDATION.md](../timeline/research/ownership/VALIDATION.md).

## T-1 Count limits (core, 2026-10-06)

- **Context:** drags and taps must be clamped, never refused (11-ui.md). The plan drops the 40 BPM
  floor for computed tempos because holds are slow.
- **Choice:** 0.15 s (400 BPM) to 30 s per count. A count already outside may stay but not get
  worse, so existing data never blocks an edit.
- **Alternatives:** 10 to 400 BPM (6 s max) as in 11-ui.md; that blocks the kit's 6.5 s fermata.
- **Validate:** V-37.

## T-2 A hold is absorbed proportionally (core)

- **Context:** "later counts shift up to the next synced count, which absorbs it."
- **Choice:** the counts between the held count and the next synced count re-space, keeping their
  relative lengths. Right before a synced count there's no room: the hold is clamped (usually to no
  change) and `clamped` says so.
- **Alternatives:** the next count alone absorbs it; or the synced count moves.
- **Validate:** V-38.

## T-3 Count 1 moves the audio offset (core)

- **Context:** count 1 is always at show time 0 (beat 0 is fixed), so "count 1 lands later in the
  music" can only be an offset change.
- **Choice:** the pure library reports `originShift`; `retimeBeats` sets
  `audioOffsetSeconds -= originShift` in the same undo entry. Positive offsets pad silence before
  the music (`audioOffset.worker.ts`).
- **Alternatives:** count 1 can't move; or keep a separate "show start" in the file.
- **Validate:** V-39.

## T-4 Workspace settings get scoped history (core)

- **Context:** the offset and the synced counts live in `workspace_settings`, which has no undo
  triggers. Without undo, Ctrl+Z after "tap from the start" restores the durations and not the
  offset: the show ends up misaligned.
- **Choice:** a tempo write logs the settings row's undo statement itself; undo/redo create
  triggers on that table only while replaying (`tablesWithScopedHistory`). Other settings writes
  stay out of history.
- **Alternatives:** add `workspace_settings` to `tablesWithHistory` (every settings write would
  join the previous edit's undo entry unless all writers moved into `transactionWithHistory`);
  move the offset to `utility` (migration); accept a non-undoable offset.
- **Validate:** `db-functions/__test__/tempo.test.ts` round trips; the owner should confirm that
  undoing a retime also undoing a later settings change is acceptable (see the ADR).

## T-5 `after` modes (core)

- **Context:** the drag rule re-spaces to the next synced count; experts need an override.
- **Choice:** `after: "respaceToNextSynced"` (default) or `"shift"` (shift past synced counts).
  Which modifier maps to `"shift"` is the UI worker's call (Alt is taken by snapping).
- **Validate:** with the Align view.

## T-6 Tap units (core)

- **Choice:** `applyTaps({ unit: "page" })` re-spaces between taps proportionally (keeps score
  tempo changes inside a page); `unit: "count"` spaces evenly, since a gap between every-count taps
  is a missed tap.
- **Validate:** E9 with the rit. in the kit.

## T-7 Tap tempo fit (core)

- **Choice:** median interval for a first guess, beat numbers by rounding each interval (a missed
  tap counts as two beats, a double tap is dropped), then a least-squares line with taps more than
  ¼ beat off rejected and the fit redone. The first tap is left out when there are four or more.
  Confidence is steadiness (RMS residual against 10% of a beat) times amount (seven fitted taps =
  full).
- **Validate:** V-40, then E4 tap-lab data.

## T-8 One rule for which count a moment belongs to (count-parity, E2)

- **Context:** the timeline readout, the PDF drill sheet and the video overlay named different
  counts and measures for the same moment (on m5's downbeat the video was one count ahead of the
  timeline). See [count-convention.md](count-convention.md).
- **Choice:** count k of a page is the k-th beat line after its start flag, so the flag is the
  last count. A line is named by the beat that starts on it; a moment belongs to the line at or
  before it. Applied to the readout, the PDF measure range and the video overlay; the go-to box
  already agreed.
- **Alternatives:** counts as the beats a page spans (keeps "5 - 8" on sheets, but reverses UI-12
  and UI-13, which put a page's last count on its flag); or a mixed rule that keeps the sheet's
  span range (two answers for one page).
- **Validate:** owner decides whether "5(2) - 9(1)" on drill sheets is acceptable; Sam's script
  (print page 12, scrub to its count 1 and 16, render the video, read all three) finds zero
  mismatches. Note T-3 calls the show's first beat "count 1"; under this rule the first page's
  count 1 is the second beat line, so the two docs should settle one word.
