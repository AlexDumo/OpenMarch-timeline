# 0010: A move can follow a drawn path

- Status: proposed
- Date: 2026-11-03
- Amends: [0001](0001-timeline-motion-model.md) §7, C-8 ("No new path style is added")

## Context

ADR 0001 dropped page-era pathways and midsets, which the app never implemented, and
added no new path style. A move's marchers walk straight (or along a minor arc) from
where they are to their end spot.

Drill writers need more than that. The pathways research
([`docs/timeline/research/pathways/`](../timeline/research/pathways/README.md)) lists the
cases:

- runs and flutters, drawn with more points than counts;
- follow the leader, both in block letters with a turning count at each corner and in
  smooth curves;
- one marcher's path bent around a collision, with midsets and quarter sets;
- double and half time, as maybe-scope.

Each needs a marcher to walk a path that isn't a straight line. That path must be stored
somewhere the resolver reads, because positions come only from the resolver (ADR 0001 §1).

The research produced a full model (draft model 5, three independent reviews). The owner
chose to build it in small steps instead, each one a lab build judged on its own. Only the
decisions that every step depends on are made here. Everything else is settled in the step
that builds it.

## Decision

### 1. A move can follow a drawn path

A transition may walk a **route**: a list of points in absolute field coordinates, from
where the marcher starts to its end spot. A route is resolver data, like a shape. It is
stored in its own table, logged in the change log, kept in history, and covered by undo
and redo. A transition opts in with a new path style, `route`, and a reference to its
route. Straight, arc and follow-the-leader transitions are unchanged.

This replaces C-8's "No new path style is added". The rest of C-8 stands: there are no
page-era pathways or midsets to convert, and conversion still keeps curved page shapes as
page-end coordinates.

Shape recipes stay app data (ADR 0006). The app may write a route from a recipe, but the
resolver never reads recipes.

### 2. Positions still come only from the resolver

The resolver evaluates a route like any other path style. The following read resolved
positions and need no code of their own to follow a path:

- playback;
- the 3D View;
- start-flag paths;
- collision checks;
- coordinate sheets;
- exports.

Nothing outside the resolver turns a route into positions.

Facing is unchanged. Marchers face front unless a Facing cue says otherwise (ADR 0004
D-7). A route stores no facing, and the direction of travel never sets it.

### 3. Storage grows one step at a time

The feature is built on the integration branch `pathways/host`, one step per PR.

- **Only what it needs.** Each step adds the storage and spec rules it needs, and no more.
  Step 1 adds a routes table with corner points only. Later steps add what they need: smooth
  points, arcs, pins, follow the leader on a trail, groups, steps per count and turns.
- **Lab files may break.** Files saved by a lab build of one step may not open in the next.
  Fork-internal data is disposable.
- **v0.1.7 files always open.** At every step, files from the v0.1.7 release open unchanged.
- **One migration on main.** Before `pathways/host` merges to main, its step migrations are
  folded into one migration.
- **One file version bump.** Step 1 bumps the file version, so older fork builds refuse
  files that may contain routes. Later steps don't bump it again.
- **Rules grow with the steps.** The timeline spec's v0.9 grows with the steps
  ([spec.md](../timeline/spec.md) Appendix I). The research docs are a reference for each
  step's rules, not rules themselves.

### 4. Edits the steps don't support are refused

Any existing edit that can't keep a route exact is refused with a reason. No edit may leave
a broken file. Each step's spec text lists which edits it supports.

## Consequences

- Adding `route` to the path style CHECK rebuilds `timeline_transitions`. The migration
  test must show that its triggers, its history triggers and its rowids survive. History
  inverses use `WHERE rowid =`.
- The resolver gains one per-transition seam for the walked path. Straight and arc moves
  go through the same seam, so later path kinds plug in without touching every consumer.
- Files with routes open only in builds from step 1 on. Release notes must name the
  minimum version, as for converted shows.
- Every app procedure that writes transitions must keep a route or refuse. This covers
  split, merge, split by marchers, holds and copies. Until a step adds support, it refuses.
- Some design work happens later than it would with a full up-front spec. Some later step
  may want to reshape earlier storage. That costs a migration on the branch, not a broken
  user file.

## Verification

- **Migration:** a migration test opens a v0.1.7 file and a current fork file unchanged.
  `timeline_transitions` keeps every trigger, history trigger and rowid after the rebuild.
  A route delete, and its undo, reach the history log.
- **Resolver:** the existing golden, property, invalidation, degenerate and fuzz suites pass
  unchanged. Each step adds goldens and properties for its rules (spec Appendix I) and
  extends the independent oracle in `docs/timeline/ref/` to match.
- **File version:** a build from before step 1 refuses a file saved by step 1, with the
  existing message.
- **Edits:** each step's tests show every existing edit on a move with a route either works
  or is refused with a reason.
