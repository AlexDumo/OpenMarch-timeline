# Phase 7: Parity with page workflows

Follow the protocol in [../README.md](../README.md). Claim a work package before you start, and append to the progress log as you go.

## Goal

In timeline mode, every existing page workflow works. Pages survive as named time labels over beats but stop storing coordinates. "Marchers on page N" means `positionsAt(end beat of N)`. "Move a marcher on page N" means editing that marcher's slot destination in the transition ending at N (D-16).

## Read first

- Spec R-E1, §6.1 (U-1 to U-3), §11, Q-1, Q-2
- Phase 6 handoff notes (page semantics)
- `docs/conventions/database-transactions.md` (ripple procedures are multi-table writes)

## Work packages

Each field is on its own line so that concurrent claims merge cleanly. Edit only the Owner, Status and PR lines of packages you own.

### P7.1: Inventory page-coordinate code

- Owner: timeline-worker (no code branch)
- Status: done
- PR: none
- Parallel: no
- Depends on: —

Inventory every reader and writer of `marcher_pages`, `shape_pages` and the pathway and midset tables. Put the list as a checklist in this file's handoff notes. Later work packages come from it; add rows for anything missing below.

### P7.2: Selection, drag and alignment

- Owner: timeline-worker (timeline/p7-drag-align)
- Status: done
- PR: https://github.com/AlexDumo/OpenMarch-timeline/pull/20
- Parallel: yes
- Depends on: P7.1

Selection, drag and alignment tools write slot destinations.

### P7.3: Marcher add and delete

- Owner: timeline-worker (timeline/p7-marchers)
- Status: in-review
- PR: https://github.com/AlexDumo/OpenMarch-timeline/pull/22
- Parallel: yes
- Depends on: P7.1

Marcher add and delete: the home position, plus a vacant or filled slot in each transition.

### P7.4: Page ripple procedures

- Owner: unassigned
- Status: open
- PR: none
- Parallel: yes
- Depends on: P7.1

Page insert, delete and resize as **ripple procedures** in app code, ordered so every intermediate state is valid (U-1 to U-3), with `test:history` for each. This settles Q-1 and Q-2 for pages.

### P7.5: Beat ripple procedures

- Owner: unassigned
- Status: open
- PR: none
- Parallel: yes
- Depends on: P7.4

Beat insert and delete ripple timeline rows (same rules as P7.4).

### P7.6: Copy and paste

- Owner: unassigned
- Status: open
- PR: none
- Parallel: yes
- Depends on: P7.1

Copy and paste of positions.

### P7.7: Coordinate sheets and PDF

- Owner: unassigned
- Status: open
- PR: none
- Parallel: yes
- Depends on: P7.1

Coordinate sheets and PDF export sample the resolver at page beats.

### P7.8: Video export and appearances

- Owner: unassigned
- Status: open
- PR: none
- Parallel: yes
- Depends on: P7.1

Video export and `exportAppearances` sample the resolver.

### P7.9: Keyframe export

- Owner: unassigned
- Status: open
- PR: none
- Parallel: yes
- Depends on: —

§11 keyframe export from the resolver (never read back as state).

### P7.10: Pathways, midpoints, step size and collisions in timeline mode

- Owner: unassigned
- Status: open
- PR: none
- Parallel: yes
- Depends on: P7.1

Path, midpoint and endpoint drawing, step-size warnings, the inspector's step size and collision detection still read page rows in timeline mode, so they can disagree with the drawn marchers. Derive them from the resolver at page end beats, or gate them off and say so. Decide what to do with the dormant pathway writers. See the P7.10 items in the handoff notes.

### P7.11: Shapes and shape pages in timeline mode

- Owner: unassigned
- Status: open
- PR: none
- Parallel: yes
- Depends on: P7.1

Shape create, edit, delete, copy to another page and the shape lock rules. Today they write shape pages, shape marcher rows and marcher pages. Map them to timeline shapes and the transition into the shape. Coordinate with P7.2, which owns the plain selection and drag writes.

### P7.12: Mobile and performer exports

- Owner: unassigned
- Status: open
- PR: none
- Parallel: yes
- Depends on: P7.1

The mobile app payload and the performer appearance export read every page row. Build them from the resolver at page end beats. If the payload moves to keyframes, reuse P7.9's generator, and log the format change as a decision for a person.

### P7.13: Undo, redo and query invalidation in timeline mode

- Owner: unassigned
- Status: open
- PR: none
- Parallel: yes
- Depends on: P7.1

After undo or redo the app jumps to a page and selects marchers based on page-row statements only, and several page-mode queries keep running in timeline mode. Make undo and redo navigate and select for timeline table changes, add the timeline query keys that the other packages introduce, and stop the page-mode fetches in timeline mode. Needs `test:history` cases.

### P7.14: Per-marcher-per-page appearance, rotation and notes

- Owner: project owner (decision)
- Status: done
- PR: none
- Parallel: no
- Depends on: P7.1

`marcher_pages` carries appearance overrides, rotation and notes with no timeline home, and the converter copies only x and y. First log a blocker asking a person to choose: drop them, keep them in the frozen page-era table, or add timeline fields (a schema and file format decision). Then P7.8 and P7.12 can finish their appearance work.

## Exit gate

Tick an item only after running its check, and paste the command and result into the log.

- [x] Every item in the P7.1 inventory is checked off (handoff notes, grouped by P7.2 to P7.14) (dropped: never implemented, owner decision 2026-09-30)
- [ ] Each feature's existing tests pass in timeline mode
- [ ] `test:history` passes for every ripple procedure
- [ ] Manual pass over editing, playback and export on a converted real show (human)

## Handoff notes

Kept current by the phase lead: where things stand, surprises, and what not to redo.

- This is the long pole. Split P7.1's inventory into more work packages if it's large.
- From the PR #14 review, the `marcher_pages` writers still reachable in timeline mode (only canvas drag is blocked), a head start for P7.1's inventory: keyboard nudges, snap/round, align, distribute and flip (`RegisteredActionsHandler.tsx` ~876 to 1213); the transform mutation in `useMarcherPages.ts` (~281); the alignment and line tools (`LineListeners.ts` ~262 → `setGlobalNewMarcherPages` → `AlignmentEditor.tsx`); the inspector x/y fields (`MarcherEditor.tsx`); `editablePath.tsx` and shape edits. Canvas drag (`DefaultListeners.ts` ~159, `updateMarcherPagesFunction`) reads `coordinate.page_id`, which is stale in timeline mode.

- From the P7.2 review (PR #20): in timeline mode, "set all/selected marchers to the previous/next page" is refused with a toast ("This isn't available in timeline mode yet.") and writes nothing, because it would copy stale `marcher_pages` rows. P7.6 replaces the refusal (`refuseInTimelineMode` in `src/timeline/timelineCoordinateWrites.ts`) with a resolver-based version. The P7.2 coordinate tools read only the resolver in timeline mode, never `marcher_pages`, so they keep working once P7.3 stops writing those rows.

### P7.1 inventory of page-coordinate code

Written by P7.1 on 2026-09-30 against `timeline-try-2` at `e429b97c`. Paths are under `apps/desktop/` and line numbers are approximate. Tick an item when its owning package has either made it work in timeline mode or shown it needs no change. Legend: R reads page-era data, W writes it. "P5" means timeline mode already handles it. Re-run the searches in the P7.1 log entry before trusting this list after big merges.

Facts that change how to read the PR #14 note above:

- The inspector x/y fields are read-only: the inputs are `disabled` and `handleCoordsSubmit` (`src/components/inspector/MarcherEditor.tsx` ~464) does nothing. The inspector's writers are the distribute buttons (~171 to 246), which go through the same transform mutation as the keyboard actions.
- The `midsets` table has no reader or writer in app code (`src/hooks/queries/index.ts:5` has its hooks commented out). Only test mocks (`src/__mocks__/generators.ts`) mention it.
- The `pathways` table is written only by dormant code: `useEditablePath` (`src/components/canvas/hooks/editablePath.tsx`) installs create and update handlers, but nothing builds an editable path, because pathways are drawn as straight lines between page positions (`OpenMarchCanvas.ts` ~1422, "simple pathway method"). Writers reachable from the UI today: none. Readers are live (page-mode motion in `useCoordinateData.ts`).
- Collision detection does not run in either mode today: its trigger in `src/hooks/useAnimation.ts` ~140 to 146 is commented out ("TODO make collisions a query"), so the store stays empty.
- `marcher_pages` also holds per-marcher-per-page appearance columns, `rotation_degrees` and `notes`, which have no timeline home yet (see P7.14).
- There is no clipboard copy and paste of positions anywhere. P7.6 covers the nearest features (set marchers to previous or next page positions).
- Nothing in `packages/*`, the website or the CMS touches these tables.

#### P7.2 Selection, drag and alignment (writers of positions on the selected page)

- [x] `src/components/canvas/listeners/DefaultListeners.ts` ~144 to 159 · W · canvas drag and rotate; reads the stale `coordinate.page_id` · P5 blocked it (`Canvas.tsx` ~238 to 244 snaps back) · re-enable by writing the slot destination of the transition ending at the selected page's end beat (D-16) (P7.2: drag routed through `canvasCoordinateWriter`, which ignores `page_id` in timeline mode)
- [x] `src/components/canvas/Canvas.tsx` ~238 to 244 · W gate · the drag callback is swapped for a refresh in timeline mode · replace with the timeline write path (P7.2: replaced by the timeline write path)
- [x] `src/global/classes/canvasObjects/OpenMarchCanvas.ts` ~125 (the drag callback type), ~1150 (`renderMarcherPositions` copies the last page render's `coordinate`, so `page_id` is stale) · W plumbing · P5 partial · give timeline-mode marchers a real page id, or drop `page_id` from the drag path (P7.2: drag path drops `page_id`; `renderMarcherPositions` stamps the drawn page id)
- [x] `src/hooks/queries/useMarcherPages.ts` ~133 to 146 (`updateMarcherPagesMutationOptions`), ~222 to 312 (`useUpdateSelectedMarchers`, call at ~281, and the selected-page wrapper) · W · the one mutation behind nudges, align, distribute, flip, circle and the inspector · not handled · route to timeline slot edits; this is the main seam for the whole package (P7.2: `useUpdateSelectedMarchers` has a timeline branch; `moveMarchersOnPageMutationOptions` added. `updateMarcherPagesMutationOptions` is unchanged; its remaining timeline-mode callers are set-to-previous/next (P7.6) and the dormant `editablePath` (P7.10))
- [x] `src/db-functions/marcherPage.ts` ~141 to 228 (`updateMarcherPagesInTransaction`, `updateMarcherPages`) · W `marcher_pages`, and W `pathways` through `updateEndPoint` (~170 to 196) · not handled · the timeline equivalent edits a destination, with no pathway fix-up (P7.2: the timeline equivalent is `moveMarchersOnPage` in `src/db-functions/timelineMoves.ts`; the page function stays for page mode)
- [x] `src/utilities/RegisteredActionsHandler.tsx` ~995 to 1070 (nudge up, down, left, right via `updateSelectedMarchersAsync` at ~1007, 1026, 1045, 1064) · W · not handled (P7.2)
- [x] `src/utilities/RegisteredActionsHandler.tsx` ~1073 to 1097 (snap to nearest fraction, `updateMarcherPages` at ~1096) · W · not handled (P7.2)
- [x] `src/utilities/RegisteredActionsHandler.tsx` ~1111 to 1141 (align and evenly distribute; `updateMarcherPages` at ~1115, 1122, 1131, 1140) · W · not handled (P7.2)
- [x] `src/utilities/RegisteredActionsHandler.tsx` ~1143 to 1156 (flip horizontal and vertical; ~1147, 1154) · W · not handled (P7.2)
- [x] `src/utilities/RegisteredActionsHandler.tsx` ~1271 to 1291 (create circle through `updateSelectedMarchers`) · W · not handled (P7.2)
- [x] `src/utilities/RegisteredActionsHandler.tsx` ~541 to 554, ~604 to 620 (`getSelectedMarcherPages`) · R · selected-page coordinates feed the actions above · not handled · read from `positionsAt(end beat)` (P7.2: `withTimelinePositions`)
- [x] `src/utilities/RegisteredActionsHandler.tsx` ~1157 to 1170 with `src/db-functions/marcherPage.ts` ~230 to 365 (`swapMarchers`, `swapMarchersInTransaction`, `_swapSpms`) and `src/hooks/queries/useMarcherPages.ts` ~148 to 165 · W `marcher_pages` and `shape_page_marchers` · swap two marchers' positions on a page · not handled · in timeline terms, swap slot assignments or destinations (P7.2: swaps the two marchers' positions on the page through `moveMarchersOnPage`; slot assignments are not swapped)
- [x] `src/utilities/CoordinateActions.ts` (rounding ~58, vertical and horizontal align ~184 and ~217, distribute ~252, flip ~317) · pure helpers typed on `MarcherPage` and `ModifiedMarcherPageArgs` · not handled · loosen the input and output types so timeline code can reuse them (P7.2: no change needed; timeline code passes `MarcherPage` objects with resolver x/y)
- [x] `src/components/canvas/listeners/LineListeners.ts` ~150 to 262 (`setGlobalNewMarcherPages` at ~262) → `src/components/canvas/Canvas.tsx` ~360 → `src/stores/AlignmentEventStore.ts` ~12 to 67 → `src/components/inspector/AlignmentEditor.tsx` ~12 to 23 → the apply-quick-shape action at `RegisteredActionsHandler.tsx` ~1212 to 1223 · W (preview, then apply) · line and alignment tool · not handled · the apply step is the write (P7.2: preview reads the drawn positions; the apply step is routed)
- [x] `src/components/inspector/MarcherEditor.tsx` ~171 to 246 (horizontal and vertical distribute buttons) · W through the shared mutation · not handled (P7.2)
- [ ] `src/components/inspector/MarcherEditor.tsx` ~433 to 452 and `src/components/inspector/ShapeSelector.tsx` ~19 to 31 · R of the `isLocked` flag, which comes from shape membership · not handled · lock rules must come from timeline shapes
- [x] `src/components/inspector/MarcherEditor.tsx` ~487 to 500 (the x/y display from `ReadableCoords.fromMarcherPage`) and `src/global/classes/ReadableCoords.ts` ~94 · R · not handled · display from the resolver (P7.2: the display uses `usePositionAt` at the page's end beat in timeline mode)
- [x] `src/components/canvas/hooks/canvasListeners.selection.ts` ~29 to 30, ~263 · R · selection reads the page's marcher pages · not handled (P7.2: no change needed; the page query is only an effect dependency, no coordinates are read)
- [x] `src/components/canvas/Canvas.tsx` ~70 to 78, ~364 to 400, ~566 to 596 · R · page-mode static render, skipped once the resolver is ready · P5 (`drawFromResolver`, `useTimelineStaticRender`); the queries still run (P5; gating the queries is P7.13)
- [x] `src/hooks/useAnimation.ts` ~44 to 52, ~140 to 200 · R · page-mode playback from `useManyCoordinateData`; the timeline branch (~210 to 227) bypasses it · P5 · the page-mode queries still run in timeline mode (see P7.13) (P5; gating the queries is P7.13)
- [x] `src/timeline/timelineCanvas.ts` ~115 to 135 and `src/timeline/useTimelineStaticRender.ts` · R of the resolver at the page end beat · P5 done · keep as the model for "marchers on page N" (P5)

#### P7.3 Marcher add and delete (home position plus slot rows)

- [x] `src/db-functions/marcher.ts` ~92 to 195 (`createMarchersInTransaction` inserts one `marcher_pages` row per marcher per page, starting at a free spot) · W · not handled for timeline rows (the P6 fixture loader calls it at `src/timeline/fixtures/loadTimelineFixture.ts` ~107) · add the home position and a vacant or filled slot in each transition (P7.3: `createMarchers({ timelineMode: true })` adds a home and a holding slot in each page move through `addMarchersToTimelineInTransaction`; `createMarchersInTransaction` is unchanged, so the fixture loader is unaffected)
- [x] `src/db-functions/marcher.ts` ~290 to 315 (`deleteMarchers`; cascades to `marcher_pages` and `shape_page_marchers`) · W · not handled · also remove timeline assignments and slot rows (P7.3: `deleteMarchers({ timelineMode: true })` deletes the assignments first and compacts shapeless transitions through `removeMarchersFromTimelineInTransaction`)
- [x] `src/db-functions/marcherHome.ts` ~7 to 30 (`updateMarcherHomesInTransaction`) · W of the marcher home · exists · confirm it is the right write for "move a marcher on page 0" (P7.3: confirmed; P7.2's page 0 move and P7.3's add both write homes through it)
- [x] `src/hooks/queries/useMarchers.ts` ~84 to 150 (create and delete mutations; invalidate `marcher_pages` keys at ~94, 125, 144, and coordinate data at ~101, 148) · invalidation · not handled · add timeline query keys (P7.3: the mutations read the flag when they run (`readTimelineMode`). No timeline React Query keys exist; the resolver store picks up marcher and timeline changes from each edit's change batch. Evidence: `timelineMarchers.test.ts` calls `timelineResolverSettled()` after each add, delete, undo and redo, then reads the new or removed marcher from the running store)
- [x] `src/components/marcher/MarcherForm.tsx` ~178 and `src/components/marcher/MarcherList.tsx` ~74 · UI callers · not handled (P7.3: no change needed; the mutations read the flag themselves when they run, waiting for the settings if they are still loading)
- [x] `src/components/launchpage/newShowCompletion.ts` ~249 to 262 (delete, then create marchers on import) · W · new-show import · not handled (P7.3: no change; a new show starts with the flag off, so it is page mode, and conversion later takes homes from page 0)
- [x] `src/components/launchpage/newShowCompletion.ts` ~276 to 318 (`applyPreviousDotsCoordinates` writes page 0 `marcher_pages`) · W · new show from previous dots · not handled · in timeline mode this is the home position (P7.3: no change, for the same reason: new shows are page mode until converted)
- [ ] `electron/main/services/previous-dots-import-service.ts` ~85 to 114 · R of the source file's last-page `marcher_pages` · import of a previous show · not handled · if the source is a converted show its page-era rows are frozen and stale; read home or the resolver instead
- [x] `electron/database/repair.ts` ~235 to 241, ~303 (`removeOrphanMarcherPages`) · W cleanup · repair · likely no change until Phase 10, since the page-era tables stay; confirm it deletes nothing the converter relies on (P7.3: confirmed; it deletes only page rows whose marcher or page no longer exists, which the converter never reads)

#### P7.4 Page ripple procedures (insert, delete, resize pages)

- [ ] `src/db-functions/page.ts` ~196 to 250 (`_createMarcherPages` copies the previous page's rows to each new page), called at ~302 · W · page insert · not handled · pages stop owning coordinates; a new page means a new time label plus valid timeline rows
- [ ] `src/db-functions/page.ts` ~264 to 335 (`createPagesInTransaction`, `createPages`), ~694 to 1065 (`createLastPage`, `_fillAndGetBeatToStartOn`, `canCreateLastPage`, `createLastPageInTransaction`, `getNextBeatToStartPageOn`), ~1112 (`createTempoGroupAndPageFromWorkspaceSettings`) · W · page and last-page creation · not handled
- [ ] `src/db-functions/page.ts` ~299 to 302, ~522 to 600 (`deletePagesInTransaction`, deletes `marcher_pages` at ~545), ~629 (`deletePageYank`) · W · page delete and delete-with-shift · not handled · must not leave timeline rows outside valid ranges (U-1 to U-3)
- [ ] `src/db-functions/page.ts` ~340 to 425 (`updatePagesInTransaction`), ~178 (`updateLastPageCounts`), ~471 (`ensureSecondBeatHasPage`) · W · page resize and rename · not handled · resize is a ripple
- [ ] `src/hooks/queries/usePages.ts` ~56 to 62 (invalidates `marcher_pages` keys), ~176 to 260 (mutations) and `src/hooks/queries/sharedInvalidators.ts` ~15 to 37 (`invalidateByPage`) · invalidation · add timeline keys
- [ ] `src/components/timeline/PageTimeline.tsx` ~35 to 45; `src/components/timeline/PageTimeline.utils.ts` ~103; `src/components/inspector/PageEditor.tsx` ~16; `src/components/inspector/PageNotesSection.tsx` ~17 · UI callers of the page mutations · not handled (PageNotesSection edits notes only and likely needs no change)
- [ ] `src/db-functions/shapePages.ts` ~347 to 372 and the foreign key on `shape_pages.page_id` · W cascade · deleting a page deletes its shape pages · see P7.11

#### P7.5 Beat ripple procedures (insert, delete, change the timing of beats)

- [ ] `src/db-functions/beat.ts` ~178 (`shiftBeats`), ~259 (`flattenOrder`), ~345 (`createBeatsInTransaction`), ~440 (`updateBeatsInTransaction`), ~508 (`deleteBeatsInTransaction`) · W beats (they do not touch coordinates today) · not handled · timeline rows hold beat indexes, so each of these must ripple them
- [ ] `src/db-functions/measures.ts` ~152 to 270 (create, update, delete measures), ~284 (`createMeasuresAndBeatsInTransaction`), ~387 (`deleteMeasuresAndBeatsInTransaction`) · W beats and measures · music and measure tools · not handled
- [ ] `src/hooks/queries/useBeats.ts` ~69 to 150 and `src/hooks/queries/useMeasures.ts` ~59 to 215 · mutation wrappers and invalidation · add timeline keys
- [ ] `src/components/timeline/audio/BeatOrMeasureContextMenu.tsx` ~140, ~229, ~335 to 341, ~470 to 477 · UI callers: add, remove and change the timing of beats and measures · not handled

#### P7.6 Copy and paste of positions

- [ ] `src/utilities/RegisteredActionsHandler.tsx` ~857 to 986 (set all or selected marchers to the previous or next page's positions: four actions, `updateMarcherPages` at ~876, 913, 946, 981) · R neighbor page rows, W the current page · the only "copy position" features in the app · not handled · read `positionsAt` at the neighbor page end, write destinations
- [ ] `src/utilities/RegisteredActionsHandler.tsx` ~544 to 548 (previous and next page queries feeding those actions) · R · not handled
- [ ] No clipboard copy and paste exists. P7.6 decides whether to add one or to close with the two items above. Shape copy to another page belongs to P7.11.

#### P7.7 Coordinate sheets, drill charts and PDF

- [ ] `src/components/exporting/ExportCoordinatesModal.tsx` ~110 to 450 (coordinate sheet export; reads all marcher pages at ~122, builds rows at ~240 to 323, calls the PDF export at ~357) · R · not handled · sample the resolver at each page's end beat
- [ ] `src/components/exporting/MarcherCoordinateSheet.tsx` ~52 to 53, ~182 to 233, ~528, ~860 · R (per-marcher sheet preview and print) · not handled
- [ ] `src/components/exporting/CoordinateSheetTemplates.tsx` ~13 to 48, ~117 to 130, ~165 to 305 · R (templates take page rows) · not handled · change the row type to a plain position
- [ ] `electron/main/services/export-utility-process.ts` ~185 (reads `marcher_pages` straight from the file), ~20 to 131, ~250 · R · PDF layout in a separate process · not handled · the resolver lives in the renderer, so either pass sampled rows in or run the resolver in that process (decide in P7.7)
- [ ] `electron/main/index.ts` ~449 and `electron/preload/index.ts` ~238 to 261 (the PDF export and per-marcher document contracts) · IPC · changing the payload is an IPC contract change, so log it as a decision first
- [ ] `src/components/exporting/ExportCoordinatesModal.tsx` ~703 to 1000 (drill chart export; marcher pages at ~706, appearances at ~741, `generateDrillChartExportSVGs` at ~913) · R · not handled
- [ ] `src/components/exporting/utils/svg-generator.ts` ~80 to 430 (per-page SVGs read the current, previous and next page rows to draw positions and pathways) · R · not handled
- [ ] `src/utilities/SvgPreviewHandler.tsx` ~32 to 36, ~66, ~129 to 136 (launch page preview SVGs on close) · R · not handled
- [ ] `src/global/classes/MarcherPage.ts` ~41 to 90 and `src/global/classes/MarcherPageIndex.ts` · R helpers (lookup by marcher and page, nested maps) used by the exports above · not handled · replace or adapt with a position-by-page map built from the resolver
- [ ] `src/hooks/queries/useMarcherPages.ts` ~58 to 125 (`allMarcherPagesQueryOptions` and the by-page and by-marcher queries) and `src/db-functions/marcherPage.ts` ~411 to 470 · R · the page-era query layer all of the above use · stays until Phase 10; add a sibling query that samples the resolver

#### P7.8 Video export and appearances

- [ ] `src/components/exporting/ExportCoordinatesModal.tsx` ~1253 to 1950 (video export; `useManyCoordinateData` at ~1350, `coordinateDataQueryOptions` and `combineMarcherTimelines` at ~1521 to 1534, page rows for appearances at ~1262 to 1317) · R · not handled · sample the resolver per frame
- [ ] `src/components/exporting/video/videoRenderer.ts` ~19, ~46 and `src/components/exporting/video/videoFrameRenderer.ts` ~9 to 16, ~92, ~106 (take per-marcher page-mode timelines and call the keyframe interpolator) · R · not handled
- [x] `src/components/exporting/utils/exportAppearances.ts` ~31 to 70 (`buildMarcherAppearancesByPageId` reads each page's rows for per-marcher-page appearances) · R · not handled · depends on the P7.14 decision (dropped: never implemented, owner decision 2026-09-30)
- [x] `src/hooks/queries/useMarcherAppearances.ts` ~98 to 190 (`_combineMarcherAppearances` puts the page row's appearance first in the stack; the query fetches marcher pages by page) · R · canvas appearances as well as exports · not handled · depends on the P7.14 decision (dropped: never implemented, owner decision 2026-09-30)
- [ ] `src/components/singletons/StateInitializer.tsx` ~41 to 70 (prefetch of appearances and coordinate data for the selected, next and previous pages) · R · not handled · see P7.13
- [ ] `electron/main/services/video-export-service.ts` · no direct reads (it receives encoded chunks) · no change expected; confirm

- [ ] `electron/database/migrations/schema.ts` ~185 to 226 (`marcher_pages` columns: appearance columns, `rotation_degrees`, `notes`, path columns) · data with no timeline home · the converter copies only x and y · decision needed: drop, keep in the frozen page-era table, or add timeline fields.

## Progress log

<!-- Append entries below, newest last, using the format in ../README.md. Never edit earlier entries. -->

### 2026-09-30 · timeline-worker (no code branch) · P7.1

- **Done:** inventory of page-coordinate code, written as a checklist in this file's handoff notes, grouped by owning package. It found 5 gaps that no existing package covered and adds P7.10 to P7.14: pathways, midpoints, step size and collisions; shapes; mobile and performer exports; undo and redo and query invalidation; per-marcher-per-page appearance, rotation and notes. Findings that correct earlier notes: the inspector x/y inputs are read-only (writers are the distribute buttons); no `midsets` reader or writer exists; pathway writers are dormant; collision detection is switched off in both modes; no position copy and paste exists, only set-to-previous or next page and shape copy.
- **Checks:** read-only searches, no code run. Searches (from `apps/desktop`, files only, then read by hand): `grep -rlE "marcher_pages|shape_pages|shape_page_marchers|pathways|midsets|schema\.shapes|marcherPages|MarcherPage|marcherPageKeys|ShapePage|shapePage|Midset|Pathway|midset|pathway" src electron ../../packages --include='*.ts' --include='*.tsx'` (74 non-test files); `grep -rlE "useCoordinateData|getMarcherTimelines|Keyframe|keyframe|videoExport|useMarcherPages|CoordinateActions|setGlobalNewMarcherPages|updateMarcherPages|ShapePageMarcher|getByMarcherAndPage" src electron` ; callers of the mutations: `grep -rnE "useUpdateSelectedMarchers|updateMarcherPagesMutationOptions|swapMarchersMutationOptions|updateMarcherPagesInTransaction|useCreatePathway|useUpdatePathway|copyShapePageToPage|createShapePages|updateShapePages|deleteShapePages" src`; beat, measure and page callers: `grep -rnE "(create|update|delete|shift|flatten)(Beats|Measures|MeasuresAndBeats|Pages|PageYank|LastPage)MutationOptions" src`; midset use: `grep -rnE "midsets|schema\.pathways" src electron`; copy and paste: `grep -rniE "clipboard|paste" src`; other packages: the same table-name search over `packages`, the website and the CMS found nothing. Test files, mocks and migrations were excluded.
- **Next:** the lead assigns P7.2 to P7.14. P7.14 starts with a blocker for a person. P7.4 and P7.5 are the riskiest (ripple procedures with `test:history`).
- **Blockers:** none for P7.1. P7.14 needs a person's decision on where per-page appearance, rotation and notes live.

### 2026-09-30 · lead session · P7.14 (decided)

- **Done:** the project owner decided that `marcher_pages`' per-page appearance overrides, `rotation_degrees` and `notes` are dropped in timeline mode: they were never implemented as features. The converter copies only x and y, and its loss report should list any non-empty values it finds so nothing disappears silently. 4 P7.14 checklist items ticked as dropped. P7.14 set to done; P7.8 and P7.12 no longer wait on it.
- **Checks:** none (decision only).
- **Next:** P7.2 onward after Phase 6 merges.
- **Blockers:** none.

### 2026-09-30 · timeline-worker (timeline/p7-drag-align) · P7.2 checkpoint

- **Done:** `moveMarchersOnPage` / `moveMarchersOnPageInTransaction` in `apps/desktop/src/db-functions/timelineMoves.ts`: one `transactionWithHistory` edit that turns "these marchers at these x/y on page N" into timeline writes. Page 0 (no previous page) sets homes. Page N ≥ 1 finds the R-2 winner among the marcher's rows with `start < pageEndBeat ≤ end`, requires that it and its transition end at the page's end beat, and updates that slot's destination. Decisions: a shape-backed transition is switched to individual points in the same edit, copying the shape's exact samples (Q-14 workaround; sampled through the public `createResolver`, so no new core export), then the slot is updated; follow-the-leader into a shape is refused (E-T5); a marcher with no move ending at the page's end beat is refused (E-ARGS) with a message naming it, left for P8.9. Everything is validated before the first write. Tests in `src/db-functions/__test__/timelineMoves.test.ts`.
- **Checks:** `pnpm --dir apps/desktop exec vitest run src/db-functions/__test__/timelineMoves.test.ts` → 7 passed.
- **Next:** route canvas drag, nudges, snap, align, distribute, flip, swap, circle, line tool and the inspector distribute buttons through it in timeline mode; read current positions from the resolver; fix the stale `coordinate.page_id`.
- **Resume from:** branch `timeline/p7-drag-align` at `5ff9f67b`. Add the timeline branch to `useUpdateSelectedMarchers` (`src/hooks/queries/useMarcherPages.ts`) and an `updateCoordinates` wrapper in `RegisteredActionsHandler.tsx`; replace the drag gate in `Canvas.tsx` ~238.
- **Blockers:** none.

### 2026-09-30 · timeline-worker (timeline/p7-drag-align) · P7.2 checkpoint 2

- **Done:** routing in timeline mode. `src/timeline/timelineCoordinateWrites.ts` (`withTimelinePositions` reads current x/y from the resolver at the page's end beat; `canvasCoordinateWriter` is the drag callback, and is the page-mode writer itself when the flag is off). Canvas drag is re-enabled (`Canvas.tsx`) and ignores the stale `coordinate.page_id`; `renderMarcherPositions` now stamps the drawn page's id too. `useUpdateSelectedMarchers` (nudges, circle, inspector distribute buttons) and `RegisteredActionsHandler` (snap, align, distribute, flip, swap, apply line tool) write through `moveMarchersOnPage` with the flag on; page mode calls are unchanged. Tests in `src/timeline/__test__/timelineCoordinateWrites.test.ts` (drag and align vertically, flag on and off).
- **Checks:** `pnpm --dir apps/desktop exec tsc --noEmit` → clean; `vitest run` on the two new test files → 15 passed; `pnpm --dir apps/desktop run test:history src/db-functions/__test__/timelineMoves.test.ts` → 7 passed.
- **Next:** the regular desktop suite (running), then the PR and the checklist ticks.
- **Resume from:** branch `timeline/p7-drag-align` at `fcd54872`. Re-run `pnpm --dir apps/desktop run test` in the background, then open the PR and tick the P7.2 items.
- **Blockers:** none.

### 2026-09-30 · timeline-worker (timeline/p7-drag-align) · P7.2 in review

- **Done:** PR https://github.com/AlexDumo/OpenMarch-timeline/pull/20. `moveMarchersOnPage` (`src/db-functions/timelineMoves.ts`) writes homes (page 0) or slot destinations (page N ≥ 1) in one undoable edit. Every P7.2 writer is routed through it in timeline mode: drag (re-enabled), nudges, snap, align, distribute, flip, swap, circle, the line tool and the inspector's distribute buttons. Current positions are read from the resolver, and the inspector x/y display shows them too. The stale `coordinate.page_id` is no longer read on the drag path. Decisions: a shape-backed transition is switched to individual points copying the shape's exact samples, then updated (Q-14 workaround). Follow-the-leader into a shape is refused (E-T5). A marcher with no move ending at the page's end beat is refused (E-ARGS); creating one is for P8.9. Swap exchanges positions, not slot assignments. 20 P7.2 items ticked (3 of them already handled by P5).
- **Not ticked:** `MarcherEditor.tsx` ~433 to 452 and `ShapeSelector.tsx` (`isLocked` from shape membership; belongs with P7.11's timeline shapes). Also untouched: set-to-previous/next page still writes `marcher_pages` from page rows in timeline mode (P7.6).
- **Checks:** `pnpm install` ok; `pnpm exec turbo run build --filter=@openmarch/desktop^...` → 4 successful; `pnpm --dir apps/desktop exec tsc --noEmit` → clean; `vitest run src/db-functions/__test__/timelineMoves.test.ts src/timeline/__test__/timelineCoordinateWrites.test.ts` → 15 passed; `pnpm --dir apps/desktop run test:history src/db-functions/__test__/timelineMoves.test.ts` → 7 passed; `pnpm --dir apps/desktop run test` → 106 files passed, 7 skipped, 1591 tests passed (at `fcd54872`, before the inspector display commit, which has no tests; tsc, eslint and prettier cover it); cspell, prettier --check and eslint on the changed files → clean (only warnings that already existed). Skipped by policy: full `test:history`, Playwright, `build:electron`. The app was not run by hand.
- **Next:** review and merge. Exit-gate items unchanged.
- **Blockers:** none.

### 2026-09-30 · timeline-worker (timeline/p7-drag-align) · P7.2 review fixes

- **Decisions (P7.2, recorded for the phase):**
  - **Shape-backed transitions:** moving a marcher whose slot is in a shape-backed transition switches that transition to individual points in the same edit. Every slot is copied from the shape's exact samples, then the moved slots are updated (the Q-14 workaround). Follow-the-leader into a shape is refused (E-T5).
  - **Structural moves are refused and left to P8.9** (E-ARGS, naming the marcher). These are marchers with no move ending at the page's end beat: a hold, a winning assignment that spans several pages, or an assignment whose transition ends later.
  - **Swap** exchanges the two marchers' positions on the page and not their slot assignments. When a marcher's slot is in a shape-backed transition, the swap switches that transition to individual points, as any move does.
  - **Set to previous/next page** is refused in timeline mode until P7.6 (handoff note added).
- **Done (from the lead review of PR #20):**
  - In timeline mode, `getSelectedMarcherPages` and `useUpdateSelectedMarchers` build the selection from `selectedMarchers` and the resolver (`timelineCoordinateRecords`, `transformMarchersOnPage`). They no longer depend on `marcher_pages`, and `CoordinateActions` now accepts a `CoordinateRecord` (a `Pick` of `MarcherPage`).
  - Set to previous/next page is refused in timeline mode.
  - `timelineMoves.ts`: the empty-beats check now comes before `pageEndBeat`, shapes are read and sampled before the first write, and the comment says what a later DB rejection does.
  - New tests: a layered steal that wins and an earlier steal that doesn't; refusals for a multi-page move and for a transition that ends after its assignment; `Object.is` in the shape-switch test; a nudge on a marcher with no `marcher_pages` row; a swap with the flag on; set to previous with the flag on (no writes) and off.
- **Checks:** `pnpm --dir apps/desktop exec tsc --noEmit` → clean. `vitest run src/db-functions/__test__/timelineMoves.test.ts src/timeline/__test__/timelineCoordinateWrites.test.ts` → 21 passed. eslint, prettier and cspell on the changed files → clean (the only warnings were already there). `pnpm --dir apps/desktop run test:history src/db-functions/__test__/timelineMoves.test.ts src/timeline/__test__/timelineCoordinateWrites.test.ts` → 21 passed. Branch head `483150f5`.
- **Next:** the lead re-reviews and merges PR #20.
- **Blockers:** none.

### 2026-09-30 · lead session · P7.2 (reviewed and merged)

- **Done:** fork PR #20 reviewed by a sub-agent (APPROVE WITH NITS: page mode unchanged on every routed path with hooks unconditional; the page N rule picks the highest-layer assignment ending at N's end beat per R-2 and refuses structural moves; the shape → individual switch keeps every other marcher's position bit for bit; positions come from the resolver, so no stale `marcher_pages` reaches a timeline write). The worker fixed the nits: timeline-mode selections come from the selected marchers rather than `marcher_pages`; "set to previous/next page" is refused in timeline mode until P7.6; every refusal is decided before the first write; added layered, multi-page, transition-ends-later and swap tests. Squash-merged. P7.2 set to done.
- **Checks:** at 483150f5: `pnpm --dir apps/desktop exec tsc --noEmit` (pass); `test:history` on `timelineMoves.test.ts` and `timelineCoordinateWrites.test.ts` (21 passed); `pnpm --dir apps/desktop run test` (106 files, 1,597 passed).
- **Next:** P7.3 onward.
- **Blockers:** none.

### 2026-09-30 · timeline-worker (timeline/p7-marchers) · P7.3 checkpoint

- **Done:** `apps/desktop/src/db-functions/timelineMarchers.ts` (`addMarchersToTimelineInTransaction`, `removeMarchersFromTimelineInTransaction`), wired into `createMarchers` and `deleteMarchers` behind a `timelineMode` argument (default false, so page mode is unchanged), the mutation options in `useMarchers.ts`, and the UI callers (`MarcherForm.tsx`, `MarcherList.tsx`) through `useTimelineMode`. Add: home at a free spot (checked against homes), then each shapeless transition whose rows are all layer 0 over the whole transition grows by one slot per new marcher, with the destination at the home and a layer-0 assignment over the transition. Delete: assignments deleted first, then shapeless transitions compacted (drop the last slot if vacated, otherwise move the last slot's marcher and point into the vacated slot), skipping shape-backed transitions and ones sharing a marcher with an inheriting follow-the-leader transition. Commit `b9ea5b68` (wip, untested).
- **Checks:** `pnpm --dir apps/desktop exec tsc --noEmit` → clean. No tests yet.
- **Next:** tests in `src/db-functions/__test__/timelineMarchers.test.ts` (converted show: add, delete, undo/redo, flag off).
- **Resume from:** branch `timeline/p7-marchers` at `b9ea5b68`; write the tests modelled on `timelineMoves.test.ts`, run them with `pnpm --dir apps/desktop exec vitest run src/db-functions/__test__/timelineMarchers.test.ts` and with `test:history`.
- **Blockers:** none.

### 2026-09-30 · timeline-worker (timeline/p7-marchers) · P7.3 in review

- **Done:** PR https://github.com/AlexDumo/OpenMarch-timeline/pull/22 (commit `7c9d2809`). New `src/db-functions/timelineMarchers.ts` (`addMarchersToTimelineInTransaction`, `removeMarchersFromTimelineInTransaction`), run in the same edit as `createMarchers` / `deleteMarchers` when they get `timelineMode: true`; the mutation options and `MarcherForm` / `MarcherList` pass `useTimelineMode()`. Page mode is unchanged (flag default false; `createMarchersInTransaction` untouched). 8 P7.3 items ticked.
- **Decisions (P7.3, recorded for the phase):**
  - **Home of a new marcher:** the first free spot, found the way page mode places a new marcher on page 0 (8 steps in from the top left, down 2 steps until no marcher's home is there; several new marchers side by side 2 steps apart), checked against homes rather than frozen page rows.
  - **Add joins page moves only:**
    - The new marcher joins every shapeless transition whose rows are all layer 0 and span the whole transition (the converter's page moves). In each one, `slot_count` grows first, then the new slot's point is inserted at the home, then a layer-0 assignment covering the transition is added.
    - Transitions are taken in start order; any that overlap one already taken are skipped (E-A3), and so are transitions that would go past 10,000 slots.
    - Shape-backed transitions, steals and partial rows are not joined. The marcher holds through them.
  - **Delete compacts without moving anyone:**
    - The assignments are deleted first (children before the parent, C-1).
    - In each shapeless transition, the vacated slot is removed. If it is the last slot, its point is deleted and the count shrinks; otherwise the last slot's marcher and point move into the vacated slot, then the last slot goes.
    - Vacant slots stay (D-13, D-VACANT) in four cases: shape-backed transitions; a transition down to one slot; a last slot that was already vacant before the delete; and a transition that shares a marcher with a follow-the-leader transition using `order_mode = 'inherit'`, because R-12 orders that trail by slot index in the previous transition.
- **Not ticked:** `electron/main/services/previous-dots-import-service.ts`. When the source file is a converted show, it still reads that file's frozen last-page `marcher_pages` rows. Fixing it needs homes or the resolver read from another file in the main process. Left for a follow-up or P7.12-style work.
- **Checks:**
  - `pnpm install`: ok.
  - `pnpm exec turbo run build --filter=@openmarch/desktop^...`: 4 successful.
  - `pnpm --dir apps/desktop exec tsc --noEmit`: clean.
  - `vitest run src/db-functions/__test__/timelineMarchers.test.ts`: 9 passed.
  - `pnpm --dir apps/desktop run test:history` on `timelineMarchers`, `marcher`, `timelineUndo` and `timelineMoves` test files: 4 files, 70 passed.
  - `pnpm --dir apps/desktop run test`: 112 files passed, 7 skipped, 1666 tests passed.
  - eslint, prettier --check and cspell on the changed files: clean. The only warnings are `react/prop-types` warnings in `MarcherForm.tsx` that were already there.
  - Skipped by policy: the full `test:history`, Playwright and `build:electron`. The app was not run by hand.
- **Next:** review and merge PR #22. Exit-gate items unchanged.
- **Blockers:** none.

### 2026-09-30 · timeline-worker (timeline/p7-marchers) · P7.3 review fixes

- **Done (from the lead review of PR #22, commit `d0024fbe`, after merging the current `timeline-try-2`):**
  - The marcher create and delete mutations no longer take the flag from `useTimelineMode()`, which is false while the workspace settings load. They now read it when they run, through `readTimelineMode` in `useWorkspaceSettings.ts`, which uses the cached settings or waits for them to load. As a result, `MarcherForm.tsx` and `MarcherList.tsx` are back to their original code. New test `src/hooks/queries/__test__/useMarchersTimelineMode.test.ts` checks two things: a create or delete started before the settings load waits for them and takes the timeline path, and cached flag-off settings give page mode.
  - The mid-order delete test now checks that the last slot's marcher has the vacated slot index, that the point at that slot holds the last slot's old coordinates (`Object.is`), and that positions a third of the way through each transition are unchanged.
  - New comments in `timelineMarchers.ts`: the `if (!point) break` branch can only run in a file that already breaks I-T6; the follow-the-leader marcher set includes the deleted marchers, which is harmless.
  - In this file, the notes on the `useMarchers.ts` and `MarcherForm.tsx` checklist items now describe the change. The query-keys item stays ticked, with the test evidence.
- **Checks:**
  - `pnpm --dir apps/desktop exec tsc --noEmit`: clean.
  - `vitest run` on `timelineMarchers.test.ts`, `useMarchersTimelineMode.test.ts` and `marcher.test.ts`: 3 files, 47 passed.
  - `test:history` on `timelineMarchers.test.ts` and `marcher.test.ts`: 2 files, 44 passed.
  - eslint, prettier --check and cspell on the changed files: clean. The only eslint warnings are two unused imports in `useWorkspaceSettings.ts` that were already there.
  - Skipped by policy: the full `test:history`, Playwright and `build:electron`. I didn't rerun the regular desktop suite after these fixes.
- **Next:** the lead re-reviews and merges PR #22.
- **Blockers:** none.
