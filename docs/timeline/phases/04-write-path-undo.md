# Phase 4: Write wrapper, db-functions, undo, e2e fuzz

Follow the protocol in [../README.md](../README.md). Claim a work package before you start, and append to the progress log as you go.

## Goal

Make every committed edit, undo and redo emit exactly one change-log batch after commit, reject incomplete edits atomically, and prove, with the app's real undo, that the timeline tables round-trip. Page mode must not change.

## Read first

- Spec §6 (write wrapper), §6.1 (U-1 to U-4), R-E1, §10.2, §12.2 (QA-UNDO)
- [implementation-plan.md](../implementation-plan.md) C-1, C-2, C-6
- `apps/desktop/src/db-functions/history.ts` (`transactionWithHistory`, `executeHistoryAction`, `performHistoryAction`), `apps/desktop/src/test/history.ts`
- `ref/history.mjs` (`rangeEdit`), `ref/undo_tests.py`, `ref/e2e.mjs` (`load`, `toBatch`)
- `docs/conventions/database-interactions.md`, `docs/conventions/database-transactions.md`, `docs/conventions/testing.md`

## Work packages

Each field is on its own line so that concurrent claims merge cleanly. Edit only the Owner, Status and PR lines of packages you own.

### P4.1: Wrapper drain in transactionWithHistory

- Owner: timeline-worker agent (timeline/p4-write-wrapper)
- Status: done
- PR: https://github.com/AlexDumo/OpenMarch-timeline/pull/9
- Parallel: no
- Depends on: —

`transactionWithHistory`: after `func`, check `commit_violations` (throw `E-T6`), then read and delete `timeline_change_log`. After the commit resolves, hand the batch to registered listeners. Discard it on any error.

### P4.2: Wrapper drain in undo and redo

- Owner: timeline-worker agent (timeline/p4-write-wrapper)
- Status: done
- PR: https://github.com/AlexDumo/OpenMarch-timeline/pull/9
- Parallel: no
- Depends on: P4.1

`executeHistoryAction`: the same check and drain inside its replay transaction, so undo and redo emit batches (C-6).

### P4.3: Listener API and drain on open

- Owner: timeline-worker agent (timeline/p4-write-wrapper)
- Status: done
- PR: https://github.com/AlexDumo/OpenMarch-timeline/pull/9
- Parallel: no
- Depends on: P4.1

Listener API (subscribe/unsubscribe), and on file open: clear the log and signal a cold build. A debug assertion that the log is empty after each drain.

### P4.4: db-functions

- Owner: timeline-worker agent (timeline/p4-db-functions)
- Status: done
- PR: https://github.com/AlexDumo/OpenMarch-timeline/pull/10
- Parallel: yes
- Depends on: P4.1

db-functions (`{action}InTransaction` functions (no public wrappers by default, per `docs/conventions/database-interactions.md`)) for timelines, shapes, transitions, assignments and destinations. Shape↔individual switches happen in one edit. Every write runs the core validators (P1.4) first.

### P4.5: R-E1 range procedure

- Owner: timeline-worker agent (timeline/p4-range-edit)
- Status: claimed
- PR: none
- Parallel: yes
- Depends on: P4.4

`setTransitionRangeInTransaction`: the R-E1 procedure (union → anchored rows → target).

### P4.6: Child-first deletes

- Owner: timeline-worker agent (timeline/p4-db-functions)
- Status: done
- PR: https://github.com/AlexDumo/OpenMarch-timeline/pull/10
- Parallel: yes
- Depends on: P4.4

Child-first deletes for timelines and transitions (C-1).

### P4.7: Write-path storage tests

- Owner: timeline-worker agent (timeline/p4-range-edit)
- Status: claimed
- PR: none
- Parallel: yes
- Depends on: P4.5

Tests through the real write path: QA-DB-11, -12, -13, -24, -25, -26 (26b informational) and -29.

### P4.8: Undo round-trip tests

- Owner: unassigned
- Status: open
- PR: none
- Parallel: yes
- Depends on: P4.6

`test:history` round trips on the app's real undo: QA-UNDO-2a to -2g and -3 to -8, a child-first-delete test proving C-1, and a `slot_destinations` delete/undo test proving C-2.

### P4.9: End-to-end fuzz with real undo

- Owner: unassigned
- Status: open
- PR: none
- Parallel: yes
- Depends on: P4.8

QA-INV-09 and QA-UNDO-9: port `e2e.mjs` to drive the real wrapper and `performHistoryAction`, comparing a DB snapshot and the resolver with a fresh oracle after every edit, undo and redo.

## Exit gate

Tick an item only after running its check, and paste the command and result into the log.

- [ ] P4.7 and P4.8 pass: `pnpm --dir apps/desktop run test:history <file> --silent`
- [ ] P4.9 passes with its CI seed count, and a longer local run is logged
- [ ] The full existing desktop suite passes, with no change in page mode
- [ ] `pnpm --dir apps/desktop exec tsc --noEmit` passes

## Handoff notes

Kept current by the phase lead: where things stand, surprises, and what not to redo.

- Undo replays with foreign keys OFF and BEFORE triggers ON, and records deletes with a BEFORE DELETE trigger. That's why C-1 exists; don't "simplify" back to CASCADE.
- The wrapper (P4.1-P4.3, PR #9) lives in `transactionWithHistory` and `executeHistoryAction`; the listener API and E-T6 check are in `src/db-functions/timelineChanges.ts`. Every committed edit must leave each shapeless transition with all its destinations, so tests that seed timeline rows must insert a shapeless transition and its destinations in one edit. Undo and redo now share the write lock with `transactionWithHistory`.
- Undo edge cases that predate P4.2 (from the PR #9 review; fix in P4.8 or a follow-up): (1) `executeHistoryAction` calls `incrementGroup(db, "redo")` before and outside the replay transaction, so a rejected undo leaves `cur_redo_group` bumped and, at the group limit, can prune the oldest redo group, which breaks §6.1's "a rejected undo leaves both stacks unchanged" in that edge case. Move the increment after a successful commit, or document it. (2) The history-row DELETE and group refresh run after the replay commits, outside it; if they fail, the replay was applied and delivered but the group remains, so a retry would replay it again.
- Optional: a `WHEN OLD.home_x IS NOT NEW.home_x OR OLD.home_y IS NOT NEW.home_y` guard on `timeline_log_marchers_upd` would stop undo/redo of a marcher rename from logging a no-op home change. Safe under U-2 (a logging trigger never rejects); harmless without it.
- From the PR #10 review, for P4.7 (tests) and the write path: add tests for E-T3/E-T4 (a block shape used for FTL, or with too few slots, on create, switch and shape update), E-A2 (shrinking `slot_count` below an occupied slot), an E-T6 row-trigger rejection, and a duplicate-id update. `updateTimelineTransitionsInTransaction` plans every edit from rows read before writing, so a call with the same id twice uses stale data: refuse duplicate ids or document it.
- Error codes: combined trigger messages map to combined codes (`E-A1/E-A2`, `E-T3/E-T4`), because the database doesn't say which half failed. Commit-time E-T6 arrives as `TimelineCommitViolationError` (history.ts), row-trigger E-T6 as `TimelineWriteError`; P8.6 must handle both. CHECK failures (I-N2, I-T5) and a RESTRICT-blocked shape delete come out as `E-DB` (original error kept as `cause`); a pre-check refusing "shape in use" with `E-ARGS` would be friendlier.

## Progress log

<!-- Append entries below, newest last, using the format in ../README.md. Never edit earlier entries. -->

### 2026-09-29 · timeline-worker agent (timeline/p3-storage) · Cross-phase note from P3

- **Done:** Phase 3 decided C-5 (revised 2026-09-30 after the C-5 rework): marcher homes are `home_x`/`home_y` columns on `marchers` (`REAL NOT NULL DEFAULT 0`, numeric and `abs(…) <= 1e6`), so every marcher always has a home and the write path has nothing extra to create when it creates a marcher. Home edits are ordinary `marchers` updates; the existing `marchers` history triggers cover them for undo/redo, and `timeline_log_marchers_upd` logs them (it fires only `OF home_x, home_y`) (PR #1037).
- **Checks:** n/a
- **Next:** the drain-on-open should also cover `repair.ts`, which writes to `timeline_change_log` through the triggers, and repair must copy the timeline tables in dependency order (timelines, shapes, transitions, then destinations and assignments), or `timeline_asn_bounds_ins` rejects the copy.
- **Blockers:** none.

### 2026-09-30 · timeline-worker agent (timeline/p4-write-wrapper) · P4.1, P4.2, P4.3

- **Done:** checkpoint `1655f448` on `timeline/p4-write-wrapper`: `apps/desktop/src/db-functions/timelineChanges.ts` (listener API, E-T6 check, drain), the drain in `transactionWithHistory` and in `executeHistoryAction` (now queued on the write lock), `resetTimelineChangeLog` on file open in `App.tsx`, and the `repair.ts` copy order (parents first, `timeline_change_log` excluded and cleared) with a repair test.
- **Checks:** `pnpm --dir apps/desktop exec tsc --noEmit` pass; `pnpm --dir apps/desktop run test:focused electron/database/__test__/repair.test.ts -t "timeline|orders dependent"` pass (and fails with E-A1 without the order fix).
- **Next:** fix `timelineHistory.test.ts` seeds that commit a shapeless transition without destinations (now E-T6), then add the listener tests.
- **Blockers:** none.
- **Resume from:** `git checkout timeline/p4-write-wrapper`; update `apps/desktop/src/db-functions/__test__/timelineHistory.test.ts` so every committed edit satisfies I-T6, then write `apps/desktop/src/db-functions/__test__/timelineChanges.test.ts`; run `pnpm --dir apps/desktop run test:history <file>`.

### 2026-09-30 · timeline-worker agent (timeline/p4-write-wrapper) · P4.1, P4.2, P4.3

- **Done:** PR https://github.com/AlexDumo/OpenMarch-timeline/pull/9 (commit `1358335b`). P4.1 adds the E-T6 commit check and change-log drain in `transactionWithHistory`, delivered after commit. P4.2 does the same inside the undo/redo replay transaction, and undo/redo now queue on the write lock. P4.3 adds `subscribeTimelineChanges` (`batch` and `reset`) and `resetTimelineChangeLog` on file open (`App.tsx`), and asserts in dev and test that the log is empty after each drain. Repair now copies marchers and the timeline tables parents first, skips `timeline_change_log` and clears it (the P3 cross-phase note). `timelineHistory.test.ts` seeds now insert a shapeless transition's destinations in the same edit.
- **Checks:** `pnpm --dir apps/desktop exec tsc --noEmit` pass. `pnpm --dir apps/desktop run test:history src/db-functions/__test__/timelineChanges.test.ts src/db-functions/__test__/timelineHistory.test.ts src/db-functions/__test__/history.test.ts --silent`: 70/70 pass. `pnpm --dir apps/desktop run test:focused electron/database/__test__/repair.test.ts electron/database/migrations/__test__/`: 128/128 pass. `pnpm --dir apps/desktop run test:focused src/db-functions/`: 462 pass, 1 todo. eslint, prettier and cspell on the changed files: clean. Not run, per the current policy: the full `test:history`, the full desktop suite, and e2e. No exit-gate item ticked: none is covered by P4.1-P4.3 alone.
- **Next:** review and merge PR #9. P4.4+ build on `transactionWithHistory` as is.
- **Blockers:** none. Finding: undoing or redoing a marcher rename delivers a no-op `marchers` change (before equals after), because the history inverse rewrites every column and so fires `timeline_log_marchers_upd`. It's harmless after coalescing, and a test pins it. A cross-phase note in the Phase 3 file suggests an optional `WHEN` guard.

### 2026-09-30 · lead session · P4.1 to P4.3 (reviewed and merged)

- **Done:** fork PR #9 reviewed by a sub-agent (APPROVE WITH NITS; no regressions for non-timeline tables: the drain is after the group asserts and before commit, delivery happens once after commit and never on rollback, the change-log triggers can't be caught by the history trigger-mode switching, undo/redo sharing the write lock has no deadlock path, and the repair copy order is safe for files without timeline data). Before merging, the lead made `TimelineCommitViolationError` safe for an empty list. Merged as 54750956. The two undo edge cases that predate this PR, and an optional trigger guard, are in the handoff notes. P4.1 to P4.3 set to done.
- **Checks:** at the PR head: `pnpm --dir apps/desktop exec tsc --noEmit` (pass); `pnpm --dir apps/desktop run test` (the regular suite: 87 files, 1,387 passed, 7 skipped; the pre-existing jest-dom failures didn't occur in this run); `pnpm --dir apps/desktop run test:history src/db-functions/__test__/ electron/database/__test__/repair.test.ts` (15 files, 503 passed). After the fix: tsc (pass) and `test:history .../timelineChanges.test.ts` (11 passed). The full `test:history` suite and e2e were skipped per policy.
- **Next:** P4.4 and P4.6 are in progress; P4.5 (R-E1), P4.7 to P4.9 follow.
- **Blockers:** none.

### 2026-09-30 · timeline-worker agent (timeline/p4-db-functions) · P4.4, P4.6

- **Done:** PR 10 on `timeline/p4-db-functions`: `{create,update,delete}...InTransaction` for timelines, shapes, transitions, assignments, slot destinations, marcher homes; one-edit shape/individual switch; child-first deletes of timelines and transitions (C-1); typed `TimelineWriteError`. `history.ts` untouched.
- **Checks:** `tsc --noEmit` pass; `test:history timelineWrites.test.ts` 18 passed; `test:focused timelineWrites.test.ts` 18 passed; prettier, eslint and cspell clean. Full `test:history` and e2e skipped per policy.
- **Next:** review; P4.5 builds on `updateTimelineTransitionsInTransaction`'s plain range path.
- **Blockers:** none. Note: the combined trigger message "E-A1/E-A2" maps to code `E-A1`.

### 2026-09-30 · lead session · P4.4, P4.6 (reviewed and merged)

- **Done:** fork PR #10's branch predated PR #9, so the lead merged the base into it (conflict in `db-functions/index.ts`: kept both export sets). A sub-agent reviewed it (APPROVE WITH NITS: every multi-statement function's order keeps each intermediate state valid, so edits and their undo can't be rejected; no function can leave a shapeless transition incomplete at commit; partial updates are validated against the resulting values). Before merging, the lead fixed the one spec mismatch: combined trigger messages now map to combined codes instead of the first half (a block with too few slots reported E-T3 where QA-DB-15/-21 expect E-T4), and the code must start the innermost SQLite message. Merged. P4.4 and P4.6 set to done; P4.4's description corrected (no public wrappers). Remaining nits are in the handoff notes.
- **Checks:** on the PR merged with the base: `pnpm --dir apps/desktop exec tsc --noEmit` (pass); `test:history` on `timelineWrites.test.ts`, `timelineChanges.test.ts` and `timelineHistory.test.ts` (3 files, 38 passed). After the fix: tsc (pass), `test:history .../timelineWrites.test.ts` (18 passed). Full `test:history` and e2e skipped per policy.
- **Next:** P4.5 (R-E1 range procedure); then P4.7 to P4.9.
- **Blockers:** none.
