# Phase 5: Resolver host, time mapping, rendering

Follow the protocol in [../README.md](../README.md). Claim a work package before you start, and append to the progress log as you go.

## Goal

Behind a per-file dev flag, drive the canvas (playback and static) from the resolver instead of `marcher_pages`, fed by Phase 4's batches, and measure the QA-PF budgets.

## Read first

- Spec §7, §9.4 (idle warming), §9.5, §12.8, §12.9
- `apps/desktop/src/hooks/useAnimation.ts`, `apps/desktop/src/utilities/Keyframes.ts`, `apps/desktop/src/components/canvas/Canvas.tsx`, `OpenMarchCanvas.ts` (`renderMarchers`)
- `timing_objects` view, `apps/desktop/src/hooks/useTimingObjects.ts`, `apps/desktop/src/settings/workspaceSettings.ts`
- `docs/conventions/multi-query-hooks.md`, `docs/conventions/testing.md`

## Work packages

Each field is on its own line so that concurrent claims merge cleanly. Edit only the Owner, Status and PR lines of packages you own.

### P5.1: Dev flag

- Owner: timeline-worker (timeline/p5-resolver-store)
- Status: claimed
- PR: none
- Parallel: yes
- Depends on: —

Per-file dev flag in `workspace_settings` (optional zod field, default off), hidden from normal users.

### P5.2: Time and beat mapping

- Owner: timeline-worker (timeline/p5-frame-clock)
- Status: done
- PR: https://github.com/AlexDumo/OpenMarch-timeline/pull/5
- Parallel: yes
- Depends on: —

`beatAtTime(seconds)` and `timeAtBeat(beat)` by binary search over `timing_objects` timestamps (Q-9), with unit tests at beat boundaries and uneven tempo.

### P5.3: Resolver store and hooks

- Owner: timeline-worker (timeline/p5-resolver-store)
- Status: claimed
- PR: none
- Parallel: yes
- Depends on: —

`apps/desktop/src/timeline/`: a resolver store per open file. It cold-builds from the tables on open and applies batches from the P4.3 listener. Hooks: `usePositionAt`, `useExplain`, `useDiagnostics`.

### P5.4: Playback

- Owner: unassigned
- Status: open
- PR: none
- Parallel: no
- Depends on: P5.2, P5.3

Playback: in timeline mode, `useAnimation` converts the playback time to a beat and fills a reused `Float64Array` with `positionsAt` each frame.

### P5.5: Static render

- Owner: unassigned
- Status: open
- PR: none
- Parallel: no
- Depends on: P5.3

Static render: in timeline mode, draw positions at the selected page's end beat instead of `marcher_pages`.

### P5.6: Idle warming

- Owner: unassigned
- Status: open
- PR: none
- Parallel: yes
- Depends on: P5.4

Idle warming outward from the playback position.

### P5.7: Fixture loader

- Owner: unassigned
- Status: open
- PR: none
- Parallel: yes
- Depends on: P5.3

Dev fixture loader that builds G1 to G13 and the QA-SC scenarios into a show.

### P5.8: Tests and performance numbers

- Owner: unassigned
- Status: open
- PR: none
- Parallel: yes
- Depends on: P5.5, P5.7

Tests: store and hook tests on a real DB; a QA-SC-11 scale fixture with QA-PF-01 to -04 recorded in `findings.md`; one Playwright spec checking rendered positions at several beats.

### P5.9: Frame clock from 0.2

- Owner: timeline-worker (timeline/p5-frame-clock)
- Status: done
- PR: https://github.com/AlexDumo/OpenMarch-timeline/pull/5
- Parallel: yes
- Depends on: —

Bring 0.2's frame-clock store (`origin/0.2:apps/desktop/src/services/clock/frame-clock.ts` and the commits that introduced it) onto `timeline-try-2`. It already tracks `currentBeatIndex`, so it can serve P5.2 and P5.4, and the 0.2 timeline (P8.1) depends on it. Check what else those commits changed before porting; take only what the clock needs.

## Exit gate

Tick an item only after running its check, and paste the command and result into the log.

- [ ] P5.8 tests pass, and QA-PF numbers are in `findings.md`
- [ ] `pnpm --dir apps/desktop run build:electron` and the new e2e spec pass
- [ ] With the flag off, behavior is unchanged (existing suites pass)

## Handoff notes

Kept current by the phase lead: where things stand, surprises, and what not to redo.

- Missing a QA-PF budget is a finding, not a blocker. Move the resolver to a worker only if the budgets are badly missed.
- Every show starts with a fixed, zero-length beat at position 0 (migration 0000). In the tempo map (`src/timeline/timeMap.ts`), beat 1 owns show time 0 and beat positions in [0, 1) are never reached during playback. P5.4 and P5.5 draw the show from beat 1; a resolver span over [0, 1) has no visible time.
- The frame clock (`src/services/clock/frame-clock.ts`, copied unchanged from 0.2) isn't wired in yet. P5.4 must call `init` from a user gesture, register `setOnPause` if pause should land on a page end, and set the beat index with `beatIndexAtTime(beats, currentTime / 1000)`: the clock's `currentTime` is in milliseconds, `timeMap` takes seconds, and `beatIndexAtTime` returns -1 when there are no beats.

<!-- Append entries below, newest last, using the format in ../README.md. Never edit earlier entries. -->

### 2026-09-30 · timeline-worker (timeline/p5-frame-clock) · P5.9, P5.2

- **Done:** PR https://github.com/AlexDumo/OpenMarch-timeline/pull/5 (commit a4b1d41b). P5.9: `apps/desktop/src/services/clock/frame-clock.ts` and `apps/desktop/src/utilities/zustand.ts` (`createSelectors`) ported unchanged from `origin/0.2`, with new tests (0.2 had none) using a stand-in `AudioContext` and faked `requestAnimationFrame`. P5.2: `apps/desktop/src/timeline/timeMap.ts` with `beatAtTime`, `timeAtBeat`, `beatIndexAtTime` and `showEndTime`, binary search over cumulative beat timestamps, half-open beat ranges (later beat owns a boundary), clamped to `[0, beats.length]`, and tested at boundaries, fractions, uneven tempo, zero-duration beats, before 0, past the end and float drift.
- **Seam:** nothing imports the clock, so behavior is unchanged. Not ported from 0.2: the `useAnimation` rewrite, the `AudioPlayer`/`Clock.tsx` wiring that calls `init`, `IsPlayingContext` removal, the canvas `setCoords` change, and `SelectedPageContext`'s `setOnPause` page-end snap. In 0.2 the clock does not compute `currentBeatIndex`; `Timeline.tsx` sets it. P5.4 and P8.1 should set it with `beatIndexAtTime(beats, currentTime / 1000)` so there is one mapping.
- **Checks:** `pnpm --dir apps/desktop run test:focused src/timeline/__test__/timeMap.test.ts src/services/clock/__test__/frame-clock.test.ts`: pass (30 tests). `pnpm --dir apps/desktop exec tsc --noEmit`: pass. eslint, prettier and cspell on the changed files: pass. Full `test:history` and e2e not run (policy); no history tests apply.
- **Next:** review and merge by the lead. No exit-gate items are covered by these packages.
- **Blockers:** none.

### 2026-09-30 · lead session · P5.2, P5.9 (reviewed and merged)

- **Done:** fork PR #5 reviewed by a sub-agent (APPROVE WITH NITS) and merged (33a8be4f). Before merging, the lead added tests for the fixed zero-length beat 0, corrected the `timeMap` docs (a beat runs to the next beat's timestamp), and stated `beatIndexAtTime`'s units and NaN behavior. The reviewer confirmed `frame-clock.ts` and `zustand.ts` are byte-identical to `origin/0.2` and that nothing imports the clock yet. P5.2 and P5.9 set to done; handoff notes updated for P5.4.
- **Checks:** at the PR head before the fixes: `test:focused src/timeline/__test__/timeMap.test.ts src/services/clock/__test__/frame-clock.test.ts` (30 passed) and `tsc --noEmit` (pass). After the fixes: the same tests (33 passed).
- **Next:** P5.1, P5.3 and later wait for Phase 4.
- **Blockers:** none.
