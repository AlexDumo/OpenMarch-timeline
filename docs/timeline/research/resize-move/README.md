# Resizing a move: drag its start and its end

Status: design, being built on `timeline/resize-move` (2026-10-08). The feel-based defaults
below are _lead defaults_, logged as V-120 to V-128 in
[ownership/VALIDATION.md](../ownership/VALIDATION.md). Open owner questions are in §6.

Owner's words (2026-10-08): "I should be able to move the start and end of a timeline/track,
i.e. changing its length. I can move the starting point of the move, but it always keeps the
same length. This also may have a lot of edge case implications."

## 1. Why the length is fixed today

A clip is one stored timeline (UI-8). The whole-move drag keeps the length in three places:

1. `TimelineTrackClip` (`components/timeline/TimelinePrimitives.tsx`) computes only an offset
   (`snapRangeOffset`) and commits `start + offset, end + offset`.
2. `Timeline.tsx` `commitRange` turns any change back into a shift of the stored spec range.
3. `useTimelineCommands.commitTimelineRange` keeps only the delta and calls `shiftTimeline`.

The database layer can already change the two edges independently:
`setTimelineRangeInTransaction` (`db-functions/timelineTransitionsInTransaction.ts`) is the spec's
R-E1 procedure. It moves the timeline, every transition it owns (C-11) and every assignment
anchored at a moved edge, in an order that undo can replay. No app code calls it yet.

## 2. What a resize means for the drill

Destinations are absolute slot points (D-5), and progress runs to the transition's end (R-5).
So resizing **stretches**, it never trims:

- **End edge:** the marchers still arrive at the move's set, earlier or later. The path is
  re-timed over the new counts, so the step size changes. This is Pyware's Lengthen/Shorten
  Transition, and the drill convention "N counts to set X".
- **Start edge:** the marchers step off earlier or later, from wherever they are at the new start
  (R-4). Before a later start they do what the rows underneath say: a page's move shows through,
  or they hold.
- Counts a shrink gives up become holds, or let the rows underneath show through. Nothing is
  deleted: undo, or dragging the edge back, restores the move exactly.

DAW-style trimming, where marchers stop partway along their path, has no meaning in drill and
isn't offered. A "stop partway" is a split, which is a different command (backlog).

Prior art (subagent research, sources in the PR):

- Pyware's Count Track has draggable start and end anchors.
- Premiere and Resolve stop a selection trim at the neighbouring clip. Ableton overwrites the
  covered part instead.
- Every DAW snaps by default and has one modifier that turns snapping off.
- Edge hit zones are 4–8 px, and they shrink or vanish on very short clips.

## 3. Gesture

- **Handles.** Each clip has a start handle and an end handle inside its two ends, with
  `cursor: ew-resize`. Each handle is `min(6 px, ¼ of the clip's width)` wide. A clip narrower
  than 8 px has no handles; zoom in to resize it. The body keeps at least half the clip, so a
  1-count clip at the default zoom (16 px) keeps an 8 px body to grab or click
  (_lead default_, V-120). Compact mode uses the same rule over the 12 px hit row.
- **Snapping.** The dragged edge snaps the way the start flag's edge does (`snapBoundary`): to a
  page line within 24 px, otherwise to the nearest whole beat. Alt turns page snapping off, and
  the edge still lands on whole beats. The modifiers held at release decide the result.
- **Drag tag.** While dragging, a tag over the clip reads `12 → 16 counts`, and adds why when
  the edge is held back ("stops at Move 4", "1 count minimum").
- **Commit.** Release commits once, as one undoable edit (`resizeTimeline`, one
  `transactionWithHistory` group). A press without a 4 px move is a click and selects as before.
  A drag released where it started, or cancelled with **Esc** (also added to the whole-move
  drag), commits nothing and doesn't select.
- **Selection follows.** If the clip's range was the selection, or the isolated move, the window
  follows the new range: start flag on the new start, playhead on the new end (a playhead inside
  an isolated move stays where it was, clamped into the move) (`followTimelineRange`, the
  generalisation of `followTimelineShift`).

## 4. Edge cases

M is the move being resized, from `[s, e)` to `[s′, e′)`. "Shared marchers" are marchers
with a row in M.

The limits (E1–E3, E5, E7) are worked out in the database before the drag shows them
(`readTimelineResizeLimits`), and checked again inside the edit (`resizeTimelineInTransaction`),
so a stale limit can't write a bad range: it refuses with a toast instead.

## 5. Merging with PR #106 (edit-moves)

- `TimelineTrackClip` is the shared hotspot: #106 reindents it and returns a fragment with the
  ⋯ menu button as a sibling. Here, the resize logic lives in a new file
  (`TimelineClipResize.tsx`: the `useClipEdgeResize` hook and the handle spans). The clip gains
  one hook call, a preview-aware `left`/`width`, and two handle spans inside the button.
- #106's ⋯ button sits `right-2` on a selected clip (z-45), over the end handle's inner 4 px.
  When merging, move the ⋯ inward by the handle width (`right: handle + 2`), or the end handle
  of a selected clip is only 2 px wide.
- #106's clip `onKeyDown` swallows arrows. Keyboard resizing (E22) belongs on the handles.
- VALIDATION.md: #106 re-pads the whole table, so expect a textual conflict. The rows here are
  appended at V-120 to V-128 to avoid number clashes (#106 ends at V-55, and the tempo branches
  at V-107).

## 6. Owner questions

- **Q1 (E8):** when a resized move would cover exactly a page's counts (or another move's), should
  it refuse (built), or merge into that page's timeline? Merging takes the move's marchers out of
  the page's own move for them, which deletes those hidden page sets. Recommendation: refuse
  for now. Revisit with links (WP-O3/O4).
- **Q2 (E3, ties to edit-moves 3a):** growing into another move on the same marchers stops at
  its edge (built). Should it instead take over (steal) the overlap? Recommendation: stop. It
  never silently cuts a move short.
