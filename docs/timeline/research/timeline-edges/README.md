# Dragging timeline edges: moving a page flag and resizing a move

Status: built on `timeline/timeline-edges` (2026-10-08). It combines two features the owner asked
for the same day, and then asked to ship as one:

- **Move a page flag** (was #110): [../move-page-flag/README.md](../move-page-flag/README.md),
  ui.md UI-16, V-60 to V-68.
- **Resize a move** (was #109): [../resize-move/README.md](../resize-move/README.md), edge cases
  E1–E22, V-120 to V-128.

Both drag the edge of a timeline. ui.md UI-15 holds the rules they share. This note records how
the two were reconciled, so the next edge gesture follows the same rules.

## Shared rules

| Rule                     | Decision                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Where                                                      |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| What stretches           | What you drag, and anything with an edge on it, takes the new counts. What you don't touch keeps its counts. A flag move re-times the two page moves and any move with an edge on the flag. A breakaway the flag merely crosses stays on its counts, because it's anchored to the music. A resize re-times the dragged move. Sets keep their coordinates (D-5)                                                                                                 | V-61, V-62, V-128; E18                                     |
| Snapping                 | Page lines and the playhead pull an edge from 12 px, downbeats from 6 px, else it lands on a whole beat. Alt keeps only the whole beat. A dragged flag skips page lines: it can't land on another flag, so they only pulled it toward walls (review: at Fit zoom, counts beside a neighbor were unreachable). Downbeats are dense, so at 12 px they'd swallow single beats when zoomed out. The whole-move drag is a different gesture and keeps its own 24 px | `timelineEdgeSnap.ts` `snapEdgeBeat`; V-64 (V-125 merged)  |
| Beats an edge can't take | It never lands on one. With the pointer over it, the edge waits on the nearest allowed beat back toward where it started and says why. A move's clip shows a dashed red outline. Release commits where it waits. The resize first refused on release; that was dropped because the gesture then silently did nothing                                                                                                                                           | `stepOffForbidden`; V-63, V-127                            |
| Walls                    | An edge stops at whatever would collide with it or cut it short, and the readout names it                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | flags: `pageFlagMoveLimits`; moves: `timelineResizeLimits` |
| Readouts                 | "Page 3: 8 → 11 counts" / "Move 3: 4 → 6 counts", then the reason                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | grips' readout; `clipResizeTagText`                        |
| Commit and cancel        | One undoable edit on release. Esc, a lost pointer, or a drag brought back writes nothing. Esc during a clip gesture never also leaves isolation (`clipGestureActive`). Flag grips are hidden in isolation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | both gestures                                              |
| Where grabbed            | A flag anywhere along its page line (owner: the ruler-only grip was hard to find); under the clips in the move rows. A move by handles inside its clip's ends. #106's ⋯ button keeps clear of the end handle                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | UI-16, V-65; V-120                                         |

## What stays separate, and why

- **The limits planners.**
  - Flags walk every beat between the neighbouring flags through the ripple's own planner
    (`planTimelineRipple`), because a flag move re-times rows in several timelines at once.
  - A resize touches one timeline, and its limits follow from that timeline's rows in closed form
    (`timelineResizeLimits`), checked against the R-E1 procedure's rejections by tests and a
    review.
  - Both produce the same shape of answer: walls with reasons, plus beats the edge can't land on.
    Merging the two planners is possible, but would walk the R-E1 procedure for every beat of a
    resize, for no change in behaviour.
- **The follow actions.**
  - `followPageFlagMove` moves everything sitting on the flag's beat: page boxes, the playhead,
    the start flag, and the edges of stored timelines.
  - `followTimelineRange` moves only what belongs to the resized move, when that move is the
    selection or is isolated. A resized move's old end can share its beat with an unrelated
    playhead, which must stay put.
  - The shared part is small. Each action documents its rule.

## Owner decisions and open questions (2026-10-08)

- **V-127 (Q1), decided: don't merge.** An edge can't make a move cover exactly another stored
  move's or page's counts; it waits a count short and says why.
- **V-121 (Q2), decided: stop.** Growing into another move on the same marchers stops at its edge
  and never takes over the overlap.
- **V-62, open.** The owner said "maybe": moves warping with the pages when a flag moves has many
  edge cases. Their idea is a multi-select that moves several things at once, where the moved moves
  keep their length. That's unlike a flag move, which changes the pages' lengths by nature. Not
  built; needs its own design pass.
- **V-65, decided: the whole page line is the grip.** The ruler-only grip was hard to find. The
  line is the flag from the ruler's lower half to the bottom, under the clips in the move rows.
  The playhead is put on a flag by clicking its page box.
- **V-67, decided: keep the arrow keys,** one undo step per press (for keyboard users).

## Not built (both gestures)

- Keyboard resizing of a move's edges (Alt+arrows on a focused handle, like the grips).
- Live preview of moves attached to a dragged flag.
- Edge scrolling while dragging.
- A ripple mode that pushes later material.
