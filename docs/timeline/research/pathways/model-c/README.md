# Pathways data model: the "lanes on slots" grill (2026-11-05)

These are the reports behind [ADR 0015](../../../../adr/0015-lanes-on-slots.md) and spec v0.10
([spec.md](../../../spec.md), Appendix J). They are copied as written, so they cite the drafts by their
working names and some paths outside the repo.

**Names that changed when the drafts were applied:**

- The lane invariants I-L1 to I-L5 in these reports are I-LN1 to I-LN5 in the spec (I-L2′ is
  I-LN2), because I-L1 and I-L2 were already the layer invariants. `E-L1` and `E-L2` are `E-LN1`
  and `E-LN2`.
- "spec-changes" is now spec Appendix J and the main-body rules it replaced; "build-steps" is now
  the [implementation plan](../implementation-plan.md) (steps 24 to 27 and amended steps 3, 5, 12
  and 17). Draft 1's M0 to M9 map to plan steps as the plan says.
- The ADR renumbering the drafts predicted (0013 and 0014) is out of date: fork main also has
  0012 and 0013, so the pathways ADRs became 0014 and 0015 when fork main was merged in (B0).
