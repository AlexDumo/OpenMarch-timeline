# Defined coordinates: what it means for a page to "have coordinates"

Status: owner decided 2026-10-08 (see Decisions); building. Started 2026-10-08 (session 4 of 4), on branch
`timeline/defined-coordinates` off `timeline-try-2` (a4d42cd1). This changes what stored data means,
so it needs an ADR 0001 amendment before anything is built.

## The report

> If I make multiple pages after page 1, say 2 3 4, all of those pages have the same coords as page
>
> 1. Then I edit page 2 to be a new move. Then when I go to page 3, rather than being page 2 (which
>    is where they are now) they are still the page 1 coordinates.

## What we found

1. **There are two bugs with one symptom.**
   - **Page mode** (what every user runs) stores a full copy of every marcher on every page. A new
     page is a one-time copy, and editing page 2 writes only page 2.
   - **Timeline mode is already sparse.** No move means a hold (spec R-6), so the **+** flag
     behaves exactly as the owner expects. The bug there comes from automatic "stay" moves that
     freeze a copy of the position: the converter, the page-add ripple (`addHoldingMoves`),
     new-marcher stays, and set to previous/next page.
2. **Prior art.** Drill tools copy sets and offer manual re-sync. Animation tools and DAWs store
   only keys. **Lighting consoles' tracking** (ETC Eos) is the closest model: an edit carries
   forward until the next cue that sets its own value. It comes with three escape hatches:
   - _cue only_: change this cue alone;
   - _block_: a stored value that upstream edits don't change;
   - a delete that keeps later cues' look.
3. **All three models agree on timeline mode:** stop writing automatic stays. The validator ran
   this:
   - Positions at every flag stay bit-identical across the 8-file conversion corpus. In real files,
     38–61% of slots were copies.
   - The owner's scenario is fixed on every way of adding pages.
   - Undo round trips pass.
   - About 15 tests that assert row shapes change.
4. **It must ship with its companions, or it regresses:**
   - **Set to next page** is refused on an inherited page.
   - **Align and distribute** write unmoved marchers, which plants stays and brings the bug back.
   - **Ripple delete** on a converted show makes later copied pages snap back.
   - The "Only change Page N" toast disappears for windows over inherited pages.
5. **The extras don't hold up as designed:**
   - **"Keep later pages" goes stale.** It brings the owner's complaint back the first time an
     earlier page is edited.
   - **Pins worked out from coordinates can't be told apart from a drag-back.** Eos stores its
     blocks.
   - **"Pin" is already the start flag's word.**
   - Defer them until intent can be stored. Adding a column is free while user version 8 is
     unreleased.
6. **Page mode: carrying edits forward through exact copies works, but needs hardening.**
   - **Tolerance:** fabric moves 29% of a selection by ε without anything moving.
   - **A merge leak:** an edit that makes a page equal to a later deliberate page lets the next
     edit overwrite that page.
   - **Undo cost:** history grows about 98×, and undo takes 5.6 s at 200 × 100, mostly in a broken
     focus loop.
   - **Pre-existing page-mode bugs to fix whatever is chosen:**
     - a copied page shares the previous page's curved pathway, and editing either one corrupts
       the other;
     - `pathways` isn't in undo history;
     - pages the edit followed don't refresh.
   - A stored flag (M1) costs a migration on a table that freezes in Phase 9, and buys only pins
     plus immunity to the merge leak.
7. **Existing shows aren't repaired by any model.** The converter can't tell a stale copy from "back
   to the opening set". A page the old app already left stale stays stale until the user fixes it
   (Shift+P).

## Recommendation (lead)

_Historical: this is the recommendation the owner decided on. Its feedback items (toasts after
every edit, a grey "Holding since" line) were replaced after the persona studies (08, 09); the current
behavior is listed in [CHANGES.md](CHANGES.md)._

**Meaning:** a marcher has a coordinate on a page only where the designer moved them there.
Everywhere else they stay where they last were. An edit carries forward to that marcher's next page
that has its own move, and stops there.

**Timeline mode (sparse, M2 core), built as one change:**

1. **No automatic stays.**
   - Remove `addHoldingMoves`.
   - New marchers get a home only.
   - The converter skips points equal to the previous position.
2. **Writes that don't move a marcher write nothing.** This covers align, distribute and inspector
   edits on unmoved marchers (compared against the resolved position, with a tolerance). A drag back
   to the start of a page box the marcher owns clears that move.
3. **Set to previous page** clears the marcher's own move on that page, so the page follows again.
   **Set to next page** writes a move on the range writer, so it works on inherited pages.
4. **Delete page in timeline mode** is the UI-9 flag delete, which keeps every later page's look.
   - "Delete page and its moves" stays as an explicit command whose toast names the pages that
     change.
   - Tag appearances move to the next page instead of cascading away.
5. **Feedback:**
   - The post-edit toast says "Also pages 3–7 · stops at Page 8", aggregated across marchers.
   - The pass-through toast shows whenever a window contains a flag.
   - The inspector says "Holding since Page X" or "Moves here", with a jump.
6. Undoing "add marcher" keeps the current page.

**Page mode:** carry an edit forward through the unbroken run of later pages that still equal the
old value. This is per marcher. It stops at a shape, at its own pathway, or at a different value, and
compares with a tolerance.

- A toast offers "Only Page N", which puts the followed pages back as a second undo step.
- Ship it with the pathway-sharing fix, `pathways` in history, cache invalidation of the followed
  pages, and the undo focus fix.
- No schema change.

**Defer, and keep the corner open:**

- A "Lock here" (Eos block) with a **stored** kind.
- "Keep later pages", which needs a stored kind or a live return link.
- Cue-only ripple delete.
- Live links (ownership 05).
- Dot tints beyond the selection.
- "Hold" on coordinate sheets.

**ADR:** amend ADR 0001 C-12 to say:

- no path writes timeline rows on behalf of a page;
- the converter writes only changed positions;
- a stored zero-motion move is designer intent;
- page-mode edits carry forward through equal copies.

Also add a ui.md decision (UI-18) and amend the P7.4 hold rule in phases/07.

**Cost:**

- Timeline: about 7–9 days, plus 3–4 for the feedback UI.
- Page mode: about 4–6 days, plus 1–2 for the pre-existing fixes.

## Owner questions

See the "Decisions" section once answered.

1. Adopt "coordinates exist only where you moved someone; otherwise they hold" as the model, and
   amend ADR 0001?
2. Page mode: carry edits forward through untouched copies now (recommended), or leave page mode
   alone until timeline mode is the default (an explicit "Copy to following pages" command as a
   stopgap), or a stored flag (M1)?
3. Should Delete page in timeline mode keep later pages' look by default (flag delete), with "delete
   its moves too" as an explicit command?
4. Defer Lock and "Keep later pages" (recommended), or add a stored kind now while v8 is
   unreleased?

## Decisions

Owner, 2026-10-08, all four as recommended:

1. **Sparse model adopted.** A marcher has a coordinate on a page only where the designer moved
   them; otherwise they hold. Amend ADR 0001.
2. **Page mode carries edits forward now** through untouched equal copies (per marcher, with a
   tolerance), with an "Only Page N" toast and the pre-existing fixes. No schema change.
3. **Delete page in timeline mode keeps later pages' look** (flag delete); "delete page and its
   moves" is explicit.
4. **Lock here and Keep later pages are deferred** (no stored kind in this change).

Owner, 2026-10-08, after the build (PR #112):

5. **Delete page and its moves keeps long moves (tracks) inside the page box** ("I think no" to deleting
   them). V-149.
6. **Page-mode shape edits carry forward** to later copies that aren't in a shape ("I think so"). V-148.
