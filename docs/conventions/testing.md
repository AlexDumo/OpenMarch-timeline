# Testing

## Writing tests

Use Vitest to write all unit tests.

Tests should be placed in a **test** folder within the same directory of the file being tested.

Never use mocks for packages or database operations.
Everything should be able to be tested with the real functionality.
If you run into trouble getting a module to import correctly, please ask for assistance.
The only exception to this is mocking React context providers when trying to render components that rely on the hooks.

## Running tests

Since the is a monorepo, be sure to change directory to the package or app where you want to run tests.
E.g. `pnpm --dir apps/desktop run test:focused <relative-test-file>`.

Use `test:focused` rather than `test` for a single file: the `test` script ends in
`--silent`, and Vitest 4 parses a trailing path as that flag's value and exits.
Tests that use `getTestWithHistory` need `pnpm --dir apps/desktop run test:history
<relative-test-file>` instead.

`pnpm --dir apps/desktop run test:timeline` runs the desktop suite with timeline mode on in the
fixtures (`VITEST_TIMELINE_MODE=true`, see `apps/desktop/src/test/timelineMode.ts`): data
fixtures are converted to timeline rows and the workspace `timelineMode` flag is set. A file whose
tests set up timeline mode themselves calls `keepFixturesInPageMode(reason)`; a test that asserts
page-mode behavior that timeline mode drops uses `it.skipIf(skipInTimelineMode(reason))`.
`test:timeline-history` sets both variables, and the ripple-affected history tests (page, beat,
measures, marcher, utility) then also check the five timeline data tables through
`timelineHistoryTables()`. `keepFixturesInPageMode` keeps module state, so it needs vitest's
per-file isolation (the default) and throws under `--no-isolate`.

A passing `test:timeline` run means every existing test passes with converted fixtures and the
flag on. It does not cover:

- tests that don't use the `base.tsx` fixtures (mocked databases, pure functions);
- functions that take `timelineMode` as a parameter defaulting to `false`, which these tests call
  without it, so they still take the page path;
- undo and redo checks, unless `VITEST_ENABLE_HISTORY=true` is also set (`test:timeline-history`).

Timeline behavior is really exercised for page, beat and measure ripple and for the mobile export.
